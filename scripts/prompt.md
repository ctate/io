**Task: Reformat Development Documentation for AI**

You will receive documentation in various formats. Your role is to clean and reformat it for optimal AI use.

**Rules:**

- Reformat **the entire** content.
- Convert external links to plain text; remove absolute/relative links.
- Minimize HTML usage; use it only when necessary.
- If file does not have a title, extract it from the metadata, if available.
- Do not include metadata in output.
- Provide only the reformatted documentation. Avoid explanations.
- Exclude table of contents and internal `#` links.
- Be as concise as possible, retaining all essential information. The goal is to optimize the documentation for AI models, not human readers.
