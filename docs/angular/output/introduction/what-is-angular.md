# What is Angular?

Angular is a web framework that empowers developers to build fast, reliable applications. Maintained by a dedicated team at Google, Angular provides a broad suite of tools, APIs, and libraries to simplify and streamline your development workflow. It offers a solid platform for building applications that scale with both team size and codebase.

## Features that power your development

- **Organized Codebase**: Angular components allow you to split your code into well-encapsulated parts. The flexible dependency injection keeps your code modular, loosely-coupled, and testable. [Get started with Components](guide/components)

- **Fast State Updates**: Fine-grained reactivity based on Signals simplifies development and helps build faster apps by tracking state usage throughout the application. [Explore Angular Signals](guide/signals)

- **Performance Targets**: Supports server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) with full DOM hydration. Use `@defer` blocks in templates for lazy-loadable parts. [Read about SSR](guide/ssr)

- **First-party Modules**: Angular's router provides a feature-rich navigation toolkit, while the forms module offers a standardized system for form participation and validation. [Angular's router](guide/routing) and [Angular's forms module](guide/forms)

## Develop applications faster than ever

- **Angular CLI**: Build, serve, test, and deploy your project in under a minute. [Angular CLI](tools/cli)

- **Angular DevTools**: A browser extension for debugging and analyzing your app, including a component tree inspector and performance profiling. [Angular DevTools](tools/devtools)

- **Automated Updates**: `ng update` runs automated code transformations to handle routine breaking changes, simplifying major version updates. [ng update](cli/update)

- **IDE Integration**: Angular's IDE language services enhance code completion, navigation, refactoring, and real-time diagnostics in your editor. [Language service](tools/language-service)

## Ship with confidence

- **Verified Commits**: Every Angular commit is checked against hundreds of thousands of tests in Google's internal code repository, ensuring stability and backwards compatibility.

- **Support Policies**: Angular's predictable release schedule and Long Term Support (LTS) windows ensure critical security fixes and help keep your apps up-to-date. [Versioning & releasing](reference/releases)

## Works at any scale

- **Internationalization**: Angular's features handle message translations and formatting, supporting unicode standard ICU syntax. [Internationalization](guide/i18n)

- **Security by Default**: Built-in security features protect users from common vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery. [Security](best-practices/security)

- **Productivity with Vite and ESBuild**: Angular CLI includes a fast build pipeline, enabling quick builds for large projects. [ESBuild and Vite](tools/cli/build-system-migration)

- **Proven Scalability**: Large Google products utilize Angular's architecture, enhancing its scalability. Examples include Google Fonts and Google Cloud.

## Open-source first

- **GitHub Transparency**: Every PR and commit is available on GitHub, and issues are triaged regularly to engage with the community. [Star our GitHub](https://github.com/angular/angular)

- **Public Roadmap**: The team publishes a roadmap of current and future work and values community feedback. [Read our public roadmap](roadmap)

## A thriving community

- **Resources**: The community includes developers, writers, and instructors. The Google for Developers library offers high-quality resources. [Check out DevLibrary](https://devlibrary.withgoogle.com/products/angular?sort=added)

- **Contributions**: Open source contributors enhance Angular. Anyone interested can start contributing on GitHub. [Contribute to Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

- **Community Partnerships**: Angular collaborates with individuals and enterprises to support developers. Angular Google Developer Experts (GDEs) represent community leaders. [Meet the Angular GDEs](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory?specialization=angular)

- **Integration with Google Technologies**: Angular partners with other Google technologies to improve the web experience, including collaborations with Firebase, Tensorflow, Flutter, Material Design, and Google Cloud.
