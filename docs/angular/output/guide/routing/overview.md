# Angular Routing

Routing helps you change what the user sees in a single-page app. In a single-page app, you change the display by showing or hiding components instead of loading new pages from the server. Users navigate between different views defined in the application.

To manage navigation, use the Angular **`Router`**, which interprets browser URLs as instructions to change the view.
