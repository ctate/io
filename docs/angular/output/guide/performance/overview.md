# Performance

Learn about different ways you can optimize the performance of your application.

One of the top priorities of any developer is ensuring that their application is as performant as possible. These guides help you follow best practices for building performant applications. However, it's important to measure performance to understand what custom optimizations are best for your application.

**Guides Types:**

- **Deferrable views**: Defer loading of select dependencies within a template by wrapping corresponding parts in a `@defer` block. (See guide at: guide/defer)
  
- **Image optimization**: Use the `NgOptimizedImage` directive to adopt best practices for loading images. (See guide at: guide/image-optimization)
  
- **Server-side rendering**: Learn how to leverage rendering pages on the server to improve load times. (See guide at: guide/ssr)
  
- **Build-time prerendering**: Also known as static-side generation (SSG), this is an alternate rendering method to improve load times. (See guide at: guide/prerendering)
  
- **Hydration**: A process to improve application performance by restoring its state after server-side rendering and reusing existing DOM structure as much as possible. (See guide at: guide/hydration)
