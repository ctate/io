# Angular Internationalization

*Internationalization* (i18n) is the process of designing and preparing your project for use in different locales globally. *Localization* involves creating versions of your project for specific locales, which includes:

- Extracting text for translation into various languages
- Formatting data for a specific locale

A *locale* identifies a region where a particular language or variant is spoken, affecting the formatting and parsing of:

- Measurement units (date, time, numbers, currencies)
- Translated names (time zones, languages, countries)
