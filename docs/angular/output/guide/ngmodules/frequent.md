# Frequently-used modules

A Module-based Angular application requires at least one root module. As you add features, you can create additional modules. Below are frequently used Angular modules along with their purposes:

| NgModule              | Import it from              | Purpose                                           |
|:---                   |:---                         |:---                                              |
| `BrowserModule`       | `@angular/platform-browser` | To run your application in a browser.            |
| `CommonModule`        | `@angular/common`           | To use `NgIf` and `NgFor`.                       |
| `FormsModule`         | `@angular/forms`            | To build template-driven forms (includes `NgModel`). |
| `ReactiveFormsModule` | `@angular/forms`            | To build reactive forms.                         |
| `RouterModule`        | `@angular/router`           | To use `RouterLink`, `.forRoot()`, and `.forChild()`. |
| `HttpClientModule`    | `@angular/common/http`      | To communicate with a server using HTTP.        |

## Importing modules

To use these Angular modules, import them in `AppModule` or your feature module as needed, and list them in the `@NgModule` `imports` array.

For example, in a new application generated by the Angular CLI with the `--no-standalone` option, `BrowserModule` is imported into the `AppModule`.

```typescript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

The imports at the top are JavaScript import statements, while the `imports` array within `@NgModule` is Angular-specific. For more information, see JavaScript Modules vs. NgModules.

## `BrowserModule` and `CommonModule`

`BrowserModule` re-exports `CommonModule`, which provides common directives like `ngIf` and `ngFor`. These directives are available to any module that imports `BrowserModule`.

For applications running in the browser, import `BrowserModule` in the root `AppModule` as it provides essential services for launching and rendering your application.

**Note:** `BrowserModule`'s providers are for the entire application, so it should only be in the root module, not in feature modules. Feature modules only need the common directives from `CommonModule` and do not require app-wide providers.
