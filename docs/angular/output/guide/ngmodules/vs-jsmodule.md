# JavaScript modules vs. NgModules

JavaScript modules and NgModules help modularize code but serve different purposes. Angular applications utilize both types of modules.

## JavaScript modules: Files exposing code

A JavaScript module is an individual file containing JavaScript code, typically a class or a library of functions for a specific application purpose. They allow you to distribute your work across multiple files.

To learn more about JavaScript modules, see ES6 In Depth: Modules. For the module specification, refer to the 6th Edition of the ECMAScript standard.

To make code in a JavaScript module available to others, use an `export` statement:

```typescript
export class AppComponent { â€¦ }
```

To import that module's code in another module, use an `import` statement:

```typescript
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
```

Each module has its own top-level scope, meaning top-level variables and functions are not accessible in other scripts or modules.

## NgModules: Classes with metadata for compiling

An NgModule is a class marked by the `@NgModule` decorator, containing metadata that describes how that part of the application integrates with others. NgModules are specific to Angular and include metadata that guides the Angular compilation process.

The `@NgModule` metadata describes how to compile a component's template and create an injector at runtime. It identifies the NgModule's components, directives, and pipes, making some public through the `exports` property for external use. NgModules can also provide services for use elsewhere in the application.

Instead of defining all member classes in one file, declare components, directives, and pipes in the `@NgModule.declarations` list. These are called declarables. An NgModule can only export declarable classes it owns or imports from other NgModules.

For a complete description of the NgModule metadata properties, see Using the NgModule metadata.

## An example that uses both

The root NgModule `AppModule`, generated by the Angular CLI (using the `--no-standalone` option), demonstrates the use of both module types:

```typescript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The root NgModule starts with `import` statements for JavaScript modules and configures the `@NgModule` with:

- **declarations**: Components, directives, and pipes belonging to the NgModule. The root NgModule has one component, `AppComponent`.
- **imports**: Other NgModules used to access their declarables. The root NgModule imports BrowserModule for browser-specific services.
- **providers**: Services available to components in other NgModules. There are no providers in the newly generated root NgModule.
- **bootstrap**: The component that Angular creates and inserts into the `index.html` host page, bootstrapping the application. `AppComponent` appears in both the `declarations` and `bootstrap` arrays.
