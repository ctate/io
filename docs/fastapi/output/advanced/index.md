# Advanced User Guide

## Additional Features

The main Tutorial - User Guide should be enough to give you a tour through all the main features of **FastAPI**.

In the next sections, you will see other options, configurations, and additional features.

**Tip:** The next sections are **not necessarily "advanced"**. It is possible that for your use case, the solution is in one of them.

## Read the Tutorial First

You could still use most of the features in **FastAPI** with the knowledge from the main Tutorial - User Guide. The next sections assume you have already read it and know those main ideas.

## External Courses

Although the Tutorial - User Guide and this **Advanced User Guide** are written as a guided tutorial (like a book) and should be enough for you to **learn FastAPI**, you might want to complement it with additional courses. Alternatively, you may prefer other courses that adapt better to your learning style.

Some course providers sponsor FastAPI, ensuring the continued and healthy development of FastAPI and its ecosystem. This shows their commitment to FastAPI and its community, as they aim to provide you with a good learning experience and ensure you have a good and healthy framework.
