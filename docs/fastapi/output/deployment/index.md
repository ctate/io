# Deployment

Deploying a FastAPI application is relatively easy.

## What Does Deployment Mean

To deploy an application means to perform the necessary steps to make it available to the users. For a web API, this typically involves placing it on a remote machine with a server program that ensures good performance and stability, allowing users to access the application efficiently and without interruptions. This contrasts with the development stages, where code is frequently changed, broken, and fixed, requiring constant restarts of the development server.

## Deployment Strategies

There are several ways to deploy a FastAPI application, depending on your specific use case and the tools you use. You could deploy a server yourself using a combination of tools, utilize a cloud service that handles part of the work for you, or explore other options. 

Key concepts and techniques for deploying a FastAPI application will be discussed in the following sections.
