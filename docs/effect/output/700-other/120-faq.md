## Effect

**Q: Is it possible to extract the types from an Effect?**

A: Yes, you can extract types using `Effect.Effect.Context`, `Effect.Effect.Error`, and `Effect.Effect.Success`. For example:

```ts
import { Effect, Context } from "effect"

class Random extends Context.Tag("Random")<
  Random,
  {
    readonly next: Effect.Effect<number>
  }
>() {}

declare const program: Effect.Effect<number, string, Random>

// type R = Random
type R = Effect.Effect.Context<typeof program>

// type E = string
type E = Effect.Effect.Error<typeof program>

// type A = number
type A = Effect.Effect.Success<typeof program>
```

**Q: Is there a way to determine whether an Effect is synchronous or asynchronous in advance?**

A: No, there is no straightforward method to statically determine if an Effect is synchronous or asynchronous. This was considered but rejected due to complexity and safety concerns. It is recommended to use `runPromise` or `runFork` for most executions, with `runSync` as a last resort.

**Q: I'm familiar with `flatMap` in JavaScript/TypeScript from its usage on the `Array` prototype. Why do I see it in modules provided by Effect?**

A: `flatMap` is a generic data transformation operation. It allows you to map data and flatten the result. For example, if you have a function returning `F<B>`, using `flatMap` avoids nesting:

```ts
flatMap: <A, B>(fa: F<A>, f: (a: A) => F<B>) => F<B>
```

This applies to `Array` as well:

```ts
flatMap: <A, B>(fa: Array<A>, f: (a: A) => Array<B>) => Array<B>
```

**Q: I can't seem to find any type aliases for Effect. Do any exist? I'm looking for something similar to ZIO's `UIO` / `URIO` / `RIO` / `Task` / `IO`. If not, have you considered adding them?**

A: Effect does not have predefined type aliases like `UIO`, `URIO`, `RIO`, `Task`, or `IO`. Type aliases can be lost upon composition, making them less useful. Instead, Effect uses the `never` type to indicate unused types, promoting clarity with explicit notation like `Effect<A>`.

## Comparison with fp-ts

**Q: What are the main differences between Effect and fp-ts?**

A: Key differences include:

- Effect has more flexible dependency management.
- Built-in services like `Clock`, `Random`, and `Tracer` are available in Effect.
- Dedicated testing tools like `TestClock` are included in Effect.
- Effect supports interruptions for canceling computations.
- Built-in tools for defect management are present in Effect.
- Fiber-based concurrency is utilized in Effect.
- Customizable retrying of computations is supported in Effect.
- Built-in logging, scheduling, and caching features are available in Effect.

**Q: I compared the bundle sizes of two simple programs using Effect and fp-ts. Why does Effect have a larger bundle size?**

A: Effect's larger bundle size is due to its fiber runtime, which is essential for its functionality. The overhead decreases as you use Effect.

**Q: Should I be concerned about the bundle size difference when choosing between Effect and fp-ts?**

A: Not necessarily. Focus on the specific requirements and benefits of each library for your project.
