# Streams

## Overview
Streams are a powerful abstraction for handling sequences of data. They allow for processing data in a continuous flow, making it easier to work with large datasets or real-time data.

## Key Concepts

- **Stream Creation**: Streams can be created from various sources, including arrays, files, and network connections.
- **Stream Operations**: Common operations include mapping, filtering, and reducing data as it flows through the stream.
- **Backpressure**: Mechanism to handle situations where the data producer is faster than the consumer.

## Types of Streams

1. **Readable Streams**: Allow data to be read from a source.
2. **Writable Streams**: Allow data to be written to a destination.
3. **Duplex Streams**: Support both reading and writing.
4. **Transform Streams**: Modify data as it is read or written.

## Use Cases

- Real-time data processing
- File manipulation
- Network communication

## Best Practices

- Use streams for large data sets to minimize memory usage.
- Handle errors gracefully to avoid crashes.
- Implement backpressure to maintain performance.

## Conclusion
Streams provide an efficient way to handle data in motion, enabling developers to build responsive and scalable applications.
