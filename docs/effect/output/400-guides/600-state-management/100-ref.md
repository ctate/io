# Ref

Learn how to leverage Effect's `Ref` data type for efficient state management in your programs. Understand the importance of managing state in dynamic applications and the challenges posed by traditional approaches. Dive into the powerful capabilities of `Ref`, a mutable reference that provides a controlled way to handle mutable state and ensure safe updates in a concurrent environment. Explore practical examples, from simple counters to complex scenarios involving shared state and concurrent interactions. Enhance your programming skills by mastering the effective use of `Ref` for state management in your Effect programs.

When we write programs, it is common to need to keep track of some form of state during execution. State refers to any data that can change as the program runs. For example, in a counter application, the count value changes as the user increments or decrements it. Similarly, in a banking application, the account balance changes as deposits and withdrawals are made. State management is crucial to building interactive and dynamic applications.

In traditional imperative programming, one common way to store state is using variables. However, this approach can introduce bugs, especially when the state is shared between multiple components or functions. As the program becomes more complex, managing shared state can become challenging.

To overcome these issues, Effect introduces a powerful data type called `Ref`, which represents a mutable reference. With `Ref`, we can share state between different parts of our program without relying on mutable variables directly. Instead, `Ref` provides a controlled way to handle mutable state and safely update it in a concurrent environment.

Effect's `Ref` data type enables communication between different fibers in your program. This capability is crucial in concurrent programming, where multiple tasks may need to access and update shared state simultaneously.

## Using Ref

Let's explore how to use the `Ref` data type with a simple example of a counter:

```typescript
import { Effect, Ref } from "effect"

export class Counter {
  inc: Effect.Effect<void>
  dec: Effect.Effect<void>
  get: Effect.Effect<number>

  constructor(private value: Ref.Ref<number>) {
    this.inc = Ref.update(this.value, (n) => n + 1)
    this.dec = Ref.update(this.value, (n) => n - 1)
    this.get = Ref.get(this.value)
  }
}

export const make = Effect.andThen(Ref.make(0), (value) => new Counter(value))
```

Here is the usage example of the `Counter`:

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect"
import * as Counter from "./Counter"

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const counter = yield* Counter.make
  yield* counter.inc
  yield* counter.inc
  yield* counter.dec
  yield* counter.inc
  const value = yield* counter.get
  console.log(`This counter has a value of ${value}.`)
})

Effect.runPromise(program)
/*
Output:
This counter has a value of 2.
*/
```

## Using Ref in a Concurrent Environment

We can use this counter in a concurrent environment, such as counting the number of requests in a RESTful API. For this example, let's update the counter concurrently:

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect"
import * as Counter from "./Counter"

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const counter = yield* Counter.make

  const logCounter = <R, E, A>(
    label: string,
    effect: Effect.Effect<A, E, R>
  ) =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      const value = yield* counter.get
      yield* Effect.log(`${label} get: ${value}`)
      return yield* effect
    })

  yield* logCounter("task 1", counter.inc).pipe(
    Effect.zip(logCounter("task 2", counter.inc), { concurrent: true }),
    Effect.zip(logCounter("task 3", counter.dec), { concurrent: true }),
    Effect.zip(logCounter("task 4", counter.inc), { concurrent: true })
  )
  const value = yield* counter.get
  yield* Effect.log(`This counter has a value of ${value}.`)
})

Effect.runPromise(program)
/*
Output:
... fiber=#2 message="task 4 get: 0"
... fiber=#4 message="task 3 get: 1"
... fiber=#5 message="task 1 get: 0"
... fiber=#5 message="task 2 get: 1"
... fiber=#0 message="This counter has a value of 2."
*/
```

## Using Ref as a Service

You can also pass a `Ref` as a service to share state between different parts of your program. Let's see how this works:

```typescript
import { Effect, Context, Ref } from "effect"

// Create a Tag for our state
class MyState extends Context.Tag("MyState")<MyState, Ref.Ref<number>>() {}

// Subprogram 1: Increment the state value twice
const subprogram1 = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const state = yield* MyState
  yield* Ref.update(state, (n) => n + 1)
  yield* Ref.update(state, (n) => n + 1)
})

// Subprogram 2: Decrement the state value and then increment it
const subprogram2 = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const state = yield* MyState
  yield* Ref.update(state, (n) => n - 1)
  yield* Ref.update(state, (n) => n + 1)
})

// Subprogram 3: Read and log the current value of the state
const subprogram3 = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const state = yield* MyState
  const value = yield* Ref.get(state)
  console.log(`MyState has a value of ${value}.`)
})

// Compose subprograms 1, 2, and 3 to create the main program
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* subprogram1
  yield* subprogram2
  yield* subprogram3
})

// Create a Ref instance with an initial value of 0
const initialState = Ref.make(0)

// Provide the Ref as a service
const runnable = Effect.provideServiceEffect(program, MyState, initialState)

// Run the program and observe the output
Effect.runPromise(runnable)
/*
Output:
MyState has a value of 2.
*/
```

## Sharing state between Fibers

Let's consider an example where we want to read names from user input until the user enters the command `"q"` to exit.

First, let's introduce a `readLine` utility to read user input:

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect"
import * as NodeReadLine from "node:readline"

export const readLine = (
  message: string
): Effect.Effect<string> =>
  Effect.promise(
    () =>
      new Promise((resolve) => {
        const rl = NodeReadLine.createInterface({
          input: process.stdin,
          output: process.stdout
        })
        rl.question(message, (answer) => {
          rl.close()
          resolve(answer)
        })
      })
  )
```

Now, let's take a look at the main program:

```typescript
import { Effect, Chunk, Ref } from "effect"
import * as ReadLine from "./ReadLine"

const getNames = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const ref = yield* Ref.make(Chunk.empty<string>())
  while (true) {
    const name = yield* ReadLine.readLine(
      "Please enter a name or `q` to exit: "
    )
    if (name === "q") {
      break
    }
    yield* Ref.update(ref, (state) => Chunk.append(state, name))
  }
  return yield* Ref.get(ref)
})

Effect.runPromise(getNames).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Alice
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Bob
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: q
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [ "Alice", "Bob" ]
}
*/
```

Now that we have learned how to use the `Ref` data type, we can use it to manage the state concurrently. For example, assume while we are reading from the console, we have another fiber that is trying to update the state from a different source:

```typescript
import { Effect, Chunk, Ref, Fiber } from "effect"
import * as ReadLine from "./ReadLine"

const getNames = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const ref = yield* Ref.make(Chunk.empty<string>())
  const fiber1 = yield* Effect.fork(
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      while (true) {
        const name = yield* ReadLine.readLine(
          "Please enter a name or `q` to exit: "
        )
        if (name === "q") {
          break
        }
        yield* Ref.update(ref, (state) => Chunk.append(state, name))
      }
    })
  )
  const fiber2 = yield* Effect.fork(
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      for (const name of ["John", "Jane", "Joe", "Tom"]) {
        yield* Ref.update(ref, (state) => Chunk.append(state, name))
        yield* Effect.sleep("1 second")
      }
    })
  )
  yield* Fiber.join(fiber1)
  yield* Fiber.join(fiber2)
  return yield* Ref.get(ref)
})

Effect.runPromise(getNames).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Alice
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Bob
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: q
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [ ... ]
}
*/
```
