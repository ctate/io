# Schema

## Overview
Schema refers to the structured framework that defines the organization of data within a database or application. It outlines how data is stored, organized, and accessed.

## Components
- **Tables**: Collections of related data entries.
- **Fields**: Individual data points within a table.
- **Relationships**: Connections between tables that define how data interacts.

## Types of Schema
- **Physical Schema**: The actual storage of data on hardware.
- **Logical Schema**: The abstract representation of the data structure.
- **View Schema**: A specific presentation of data tailored for user access.

## Best Practices
- Ensure normalization to reduce redundancy.
- Use clear naming conventions for tables and fields.
- Document relationships and constraints for clarity.

## Tools
- Database Management Systems (DBMS) for schema creation and management.
- ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) tools for visual representation.

## Conclusion
A well-defined schema is crucial for efficient data management and retrieval, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.
