# Code Style

## General Guidelines
- Follow consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
- Use meaningful names that convey the purpose of the code.
- Maintain a consistent indentation style (e.g., 2 or 4 spaces).
- Limit line length to 80-120 characters.

## Comments
- Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic.
- Use comments to describe the purpose of functions and classes.
- Avoid redundant comments that restate the code.

## Formatting
- Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code.
- Group related functions and classes together.
- Ensure proper spacing around operators and after commas.

## Code Structure
- Organize code into modules and packages for better maintainability.
- Follow the single responsibility principle for functions and classes.
- Keep functions short and focused on a single task.

## Error Handling
- Use exceptions for error handling instead of return codes.
- Provide meaningful error messages to aid debugging.

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- Ensure tests are easy to read and maintain.

## Version Control
- Commit code changes frequently with clear, descriptive messages.
- Use branches for new features and bug fixes.
