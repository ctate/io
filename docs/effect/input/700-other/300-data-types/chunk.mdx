excerpt: Explore the benefits of using `Chunk`, an immutable and high-performance array-like data structure in JavaScript. Learn about its advantages, including immutability for concurrent programming and specialized operations for efficient array manipulations. Discover operations like creating, concatenating, dropping elements, comparing for equality, and converting to a `ReadonlyArray`.

A `Chunk<A>` represents a chunk of values of type `A`.
Chunks are usually backed by arrays, but expose a purely functional, safe interface to the underlying elements, and they become lazy on operations that would be costly with arrays, such as repeated concatenation. Like lists and arrays, `Chunk` is an ordered collection.

<Warning>
  `Chunk` is purpose-built to amoritize the cost of repeated concatenation of
  arrays. Therefore, for use-cases that **do not** involve repeated
  concatenation of arrays, the overhead of `Chunk` will result in reduced
  performance.
</Warning>

## Why Chunk?

Let's explore the reasons behind using `Chunk`:

- **Immutability**: In JavaScript, there is no built-in immutable data type that can efficiently represent an array. While the `Array` type exists, it provides a mutable interface, which means it can be modified after creation. `Chunk`, on the other hand, is an immutable array-like data structure that ensures the data remains unchanged. Immutability is beneficial in various scenarios, especially when dealing with concurrent programming.

- **High Performance**: `Chunk` not only offers immutability but also delivers high performance. It provides specialized operations for common array manipulations, such as appending a single element or concatenating two `Chunk`s together. These specialized operations are significantly faster than performing the same operations on regular JavaScript arrays.

## Operations

### Creating

To create an empty `Chunk`, you can use the following code:

```ts twoslash
import { Chunk } from "effect"

const emptyChunk = Chunk.empty()
```

If you want to create a `Chunk` with specific values, you can use the `Chunk.make(...values)` function:

```ts twoslash
import { Chunk } from "effect"

const nonEmptyChunk = Chunk.make(1, 2, 3)
```

Alternatively, you can create a `Chunk` by providing a collection of values. There are multiple ways to achieve this:

- Creating a `Chunk` from a generic `Iterable`:

  ```ts twoslash
  import { Chunk, List } from "effect"

  const fromArray = Chunk.fromIterable([1, 2, 3])

  const fromList = Chunk.fromIterable(List.make(1, 2, 3))
  ```

- Creating a `Chunk` from an `Array`:

  ```ts twoslash
  import { Chunk } from "effect"

  const fromUnsafeArray = Chunk.unsafeFromArray([1, 2, 3])
  ```

`Chunk.fromIterable` makes a chunk by cloning the iterable, which can be an expensive process for large iterables or when making many Chunks. `unsafeFromArray` doesn't do any cloning which can have performance benefits, but this breaks the assumption that Chunk is immutable.

<Warning>
  It is important to note that using `unsafeFromArray` can potentially lead to
  unsafe or unexpected behavior if the input array is mutated after
  conversion. If you want to ensure safety, it is recommended to use
  `fromIterable`.
</Warning>

### Concatenating

You can concatenate two Chunks using the `appendAll` function:

```ts twoslash
import { Chunk } from "effect"

const concatenatedChunk = Chunk.appendAll(
  Chunk.make(1, 2),
  Chunk.make("a", "b")
)

console.log(concatenatedChunk)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [ 1, 2, "a", "b" ]
}
*/
```

### Dropping

To drop elements from the beginning of a `Chunk`, you can use the `drop` function:

```ts twoslash
import { Chunk } from "effect"

const droppedChunk = Chunk.drop(Chunk.make(1, 2, 3, 4), 2) // Drops the first 2 elements from the Chunk
```

### Comparing

You can compare two `Chunk`s for equality using the `Equal.equals` function:

```ts twoslash
import { Chunk, Equal } from "effect"

const chunk1 = Chunk.make(1, 2)
const chunk2 = Chunk.make(1, 2, 3)

const areEqual = Equal.equals(chunk1, chunk2)
```

### Converting

To convert a `Chunk` to a `ReadonlyArray`, you can use the `toReadonlyArray` function:

```ts twoslash
import { Chunk } from "effect"

const readonlyArray = Chunk.toReadonlyArray(Chunk.make(1, 2, 3))
```
