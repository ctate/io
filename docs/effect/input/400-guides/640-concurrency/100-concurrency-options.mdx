title: Concurrency Options
excerpt: Effect provides powerful options to manage the execution of effects, offering control over the concurrency of operations. Explore the `concurrency` option, a key factor in determining how many effects can run concurrently. This concise guide delves into sequential execution, numbered concurrency, unbounded concurrency, and the flexible inherit concurrency option. Learn to harness these options to optimize the performance of your Effect programs and tailor the concurrency behavior to your specific use cases.

Effect offers various options to manage how effects are executed and control the overall operation's result. These options help determine how many effects can run at the same time concurrently.

```ts
type Options = {
  readonly concurrency?: Concurrency
  /* ... other options ... */
}
```

In this section, we'll focus on the option that handles concurrency, which is the `concurrency` option with a type of `Concurrency`:

```ts
type Concurrency = number | "unbounded" | "inherit"
```

Let's understand the meaning of each configuration value.

<Info>
  The following examples use the `Effect.all` function, but the concept
  applies to many other Effect APIs that accept concurrency options, such as
  `Effect.forEach`.

## Sequential Execution (Default)

By default, if you don't specify any concurrency option, effects will run sequentially, one after the other. This means each effect starts only after the previous one completes.

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Duration } from "effect"

const makeTask = (n: number, delay: Duration.DurationInput) =>
  Effect.promise(
    () =>
      new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
        console.log(`start task${n}`)
        setTimeout(() => {
          console.log(`task${n} done`)
          resolve()
        }, Duration.toMillis(delay))
      })
  )

const task1 = makeTask(1, "200 millis")
const task2 = makeTask(2, "100 millis")

const sequential = Effect.all([task1, task2])

Effect.runPromise(sequential)
/*
Output:
start task1
task1 done
start task2 <-- task2 starts only after task1 completes
task2 done
*/
```

## Numbered Concurrency

You can control the number of concurrent operations with the `concurrency` option. For example, with `concurrency: 2`, up to 2 effects will run simultaneously.

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Duration } from "effect"

const makeTask = (n: number, delay: Duration.DurationInput) =>
  Effect.promise(
    () =>
      new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
        console.log(`start task${n}`)
        setTimeout(() => {
          console.log(`task${n} done`)
          resolve()
        }, Duration.toMillis(delay))
      })
  )

const task1 = makeTask(1, "200 millis")
const task2 = makeTask(2, "100 millis")
const task3 = makeTask(3, "210 millis")
const task4 = makeTask(4, "110 millis")
const task5 = makeTask(5, "150 millis")

const number = Effect.all([task1, task2, task3, task4, task5], {
  concurrency: 2
})

Effect.runPromise(number)
/*
Output:
start task1
start task2 <-- active tasks: task1, task2
task2 done
start task3 <-- active tasks: task1, task3
task1 done
start task4 <-- active tasks: task3, task4
task4 done
start task5 <-- active tasks: task3, task5
task3 done
task5 done
*/
```

## Unbounded Concurrency

If you set `concurrency: "unbounded"`, as many effects as needed will run concurrently, without any specific limit.

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Duration } from "effect"

const makeTask = (n: number, delay: Duration.DurationInput) =>
  Effect.promise(
    () =>
      new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
        console.log(`start task${n}`)
        setTimeout(() => {
          console.log(`task${n} done`)
          resolve()
        }, Duration.toMillis(delay))
      })
  )

const task1 = makeTask(1, "200 millis")
const task2 = makeTask(2, "100 millis")
const task3 = makeTask(3, "210 millis")
const task4 = makeTask(4, "110 millis")
const task5 = makeTask(5, "150 millis")

const unbounded = Effect.all([task1, task2, task3, task4, task5], {
  concurrency: "unbounded"
})

Effect.runPromise(unbounded)
/*
Output:
start task1
start task2
start task3
start task4
start task5
task2 done
task4 done
task5 done
task1 done
task3 done
*/
```

## Inherit Concurrency

The `concurrency: "inherit"` option adapts based on context, controlled by `Effect.withConcurrency(number | "unbounded")`.

If there's no `Effect.withConcurrency` call, the default is `"unbounded"`. Otherwise, it inherits the configuration set by `Effect.withConcurrency`.

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Duration } from "effect"

const makeTask = (n: number, delay: Duration.DurationInput) =>
  Effect.promise(
    () =>
      new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
        console.log(`start task${n}`)
        setTimeout(() => {
          console.log(`task${n} done`)
          resolve()
        }, Duration.toMillis(delay))
      })
  )

const task1 = makeTask(1, "200 millis")
const task2 = makeTask(2, "100 millis")
const task3 = makeTask(3, "210 millis")
const task4 = makeTask(4, "110 millis")
const task5 = makeTask(5, "150 millis")

const inherit = Effect.all([task1, task2, task3, task4, task5], {
  concurrency: "inherit"
})

Effect.runPromise(inherit)
/*
Output:
start task1
start task2
start task3
start task4
start task5
task2 done
task4 done
task5 done
task1 done
task3 done
*/
```

If you use `Effect.withConcurrency`, it will adopt that specific concurrency configuration.

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Duration } from "effect"

const makeTask = (n: number, delay: Duration.DurationInput) =>
  Effect.promise(
    () =>
      new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
        console.log(`start task${n}`)
        setTimeout(() => {
          console.log(`task${n} done`)
          resolve()
        }, Duration.toMillis(delay))
      })
  )

const task1 = makeTask(1, "200 millis")
const task2 = makeTask(2, "100 millis")
const task3 = makeTask(3, "210 millis")
const task4 = makeTask(4, "110 millis")
const task5 = makeTask(5, "150 millis")

const inherit = Effect.all([task1, task2, task3, task4, task5], {
  concurrency: "inherit"
})

const withConcurrency = inherit.pipe(Effect.withConcurrency(2))

Effect.runPromise(withConcurrency)
/*
Output:
start task1
start task2 <-- active tasks: task1, task2
task2 done
start task3 <-- active tasks: task1, task3
task1 done
start task4 <-- active tasks: task3, task4
task4 done
start task5 <-- active tasks: task3, task5
task3 done
task5 done
*/
```
