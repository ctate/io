# trailingSlash

Configure Next.js pages to resolve with or without a trailing slash.

## Overview

The `trailingSlash` configuration option in Next.js allows you to specify whether your pages should be served with a trailing slash or not. This can be important for SEO and user experience, as it affects how URLs are structured and accessed.

## Usage

To configure the `trailingSlash` option, add it to your `next.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  trailingSlash: true, // or false
}
```

- Setting `trailingSlash` to `true` will ensure that all pages are served with a trailing slash (e.g., `/about/`).
- Setting it to `false` will serve pages without a trailing slash (e.g., `/about`).

## Considerations

- Be mindful of how this setting interacts with your existing routes and links.
- Changing this setting may affect your site's SEO, so consider implementing redirects if necessary.
