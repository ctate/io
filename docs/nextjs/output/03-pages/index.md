# Pages Router

Before Next.js 13, the Pages Router was the main way to create routes in Next.js. It used an intuitive file-system router to map each file to a route. The Pages Router is still supported in newer versions of Next.js, but it is recommended to migrate to the new App Router to leverage React's latest features.

Use this section of the documentation for existing applications that use the Pages Router.
