# Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

Learn how to create or update static pages at runtime with Incremental Static Regeneration.

## Overview

Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) allows you to update static pages after youâ€™ve built your site. This means you can create or update pages in the background while serving static content to users.

## Key Concepts

- **Static Generation**: Pre-rendering pages at build time.
- **Revalidation**: Updating static pages at runtime based on a defined interval.
- **Fallback**: Serving a fallback version of a page while the new version is being generated.

## Usage

To implement ISR, you need to use the `getStaticProps` function in your page component. Specify the `revalidate` property to define how often a page should be regenerated.

Example:

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const data = await fetchData();
  
  return {
    props: { data },
    revalidate: 10, // Regenerate the page every 10 seconds
  };
}
```

## Benefits

- Improved performance by serving static content.
- Ability to keep content up-to-date without a full rebuild.
- Enhanced user experience with faster load times.

## Considerations

- Ensure your data fetching logic can handle revalidation.
- Be mindful of the revalidation interval to balance freshness and performance.
