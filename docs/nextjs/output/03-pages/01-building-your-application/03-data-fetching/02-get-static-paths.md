# getStaticPaths

Fetch data and generate static pages with `getStaticPaths`. Learn more about this API for data fetching in Next.js.

If a page has Dynamic Routes and uses `getStaticProps`, it needs to define a list of paths to be statically generated.

When you export a function called `getStaticPaths` (Static Site Generation) from a page that uses dynamic routes, Next.js will statically pre-render all the paths specified by `getStaticPaths`.

```tsx
import type {
  InferGetStaticPropsType,
  GetStaticProps,
  GetStaticPaths,
} from 'next'

type Repo = {
  name: string
  stargazers_count: number
}

export const getStaticPaths = (async () => {
  return {
    paths: [
      {
        params: {
          name: 'next.js',
        },
      },
    ],
    fallback: true,
  }
}) satisfies GetStaticPaths

export const getStaticProps = (async (context) => {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')
  const repo = await res.json()
  return { props: { repo } }
}) satisfies GetStaticProps<{
  repo: Repo
}>

export default function Page({
  repo,
}: InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticProps>) {
  return repo.stargazers_count
}
```

```jsx
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return {
    paths: [
      {
        params: {
          name: 'next.js',
        },
      },
    ],
    fallback: true,
  }
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')
  const repo = await res.json()
  return { props: { repo } }
}

export default function Page({ repo }) {
  return repo.stargazers_count
}
```

The getStaticPaths API reference covers all parameters and props that can be used with `getStaticPaths`.

## When should I use getStaticPaths?

Use `getStaticPaths` if youâ€™re statically pre-rendering pages that use dynamic routes and:

- The data comes from a headless CMS
- The data comes from a database
- The data comes from the filesystem
- The data can be publicly cached (not user-specific)
- The page must be pre-rendered (for SEO) and be very fast

## When does getStaticPaths run

`getStaticPaths` runs during build in production and will not be called during runtime. You can validate code written inside `getStaticPaths` is removed from the client-side bundle.

### How does getStaticProps run with regards to getStaticPaths

- `getStaticProps` runs during `next build` for any `paths` returned during build
- `getStaticProps` runs in the background when using `fallback: true`
- `getStaticProps` is called before initial render when using `fallback: blocking`

## Where can I use getStaticPaths

- `getStaticPaths` must be used with `getStaticProps`
- You cannot use `getStaticPaths` with `getServerSideProps`
- You can export `getStaticPaths` from a Dynamic Route that also uses `getStaticProps`
- You cannot export `getStaticPaths` from non-page files (e.g., your components folder)
- You must export `getStaticPaths` as a standalone function, not a property of the page component

## Runs on every request in development

In development, `getStaticPaths` will be called on every request.

## Generating paths on-demand

`getStaticPaths` allows you to control which pages are generated during the build instead of on-demand with fallback. Generating more pages during a build will cause slower builds.

You can defer generating all pages on-demand by returning an empty array for `paths`. This can be helpful when deploying your Next.js application to multiple environments. For example, you can have faster builds by generating all pages on-demand for previews (but not production builds).

```jsx
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  if (process.env.SKIP_BUILD_STATIC_GENERATION) {
    return {
      paths: [],
      fallback: 'blocking',
    }
  }

  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')
  const posts = await res.json()

  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { id: post.id },
  }))

  return { paths, fallback: false }
}
```
