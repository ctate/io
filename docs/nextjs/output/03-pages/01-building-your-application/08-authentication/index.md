# Authentication

Learn how to implement authentication in Next.js, covering best practices, securing routes, authorization techniques, and session management.

## Best Practices

- Use secure password storage techniques (e.g., bcrypt).
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.
- Regularly update dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities.

## Securing Routes

- Protect sensitive routes by checking user authentication status.
- Use middleware to enforce authentication on specific pages or API routes.

## Authorization Techniques

- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions.
- Use claims-based authorization for fine-grained access control.

## Session Management

- Use secure cookies for session management.
- Implement session expiration and renewal strategies to enhance security.
