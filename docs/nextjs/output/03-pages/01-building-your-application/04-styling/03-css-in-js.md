# CSS-in-JS

Use CSS-in-JS libraries with Next.js.

## Overview

CSS-in-JS is a popular approach for styling applications, allowing you to write CSS directly within your JavaScript files. This method provides benefits such as scoped styles, dynamic styling, and easier maintenance.

## Libraries

Several CSS-in-JS libraries can be used with Next.js, including:

- **Styled Components**: A library for styling React components using tagged template literals.
- **Emotion**: A performant and flexible CSS-in-JS library that allows for both styled components and CSS prop usage.
- **JSS**: A library for writing CSS styles with JavaScript, providing a powerful API for dynamic styling.

## Installation

To use a CSS-in-JS library, install it via npm or yarn. For example, to install Styled Components, run:

```
npm install styled-components
```

or

```
yarn add styled-components
```

## Usage

### Styled Components Example

1. Create a styled component:

```javascript
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
`;
```

2. Use the styled component in your application:

```javascript
function App() {
  return <Button>Click Me</Button>;
}
```

### Emotion Example

1. Install Emotion:

```
npm install @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

2. Create a styled component:

```javascript
/** @jsxImportSource @emotion/react */
import styled from '@emotion/styled';

const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
`;
```

3. Use the styled component:

```javascript
function App() {
  return <Button>Click Me</Button>;
}
```

## Server-Side Rendering

Next.js supports server-side rendering (SSR) for CSS-in-JS libraries. Ensure you follow the library's documentation for proper SSR setup to avoid style mismatches.

## Conclusion

CSS-in-JS libraries provide a powerful way to manage styles in Next.js applications. Choose a library that fits your needs and follow the installation and usage guidelines to get started.
