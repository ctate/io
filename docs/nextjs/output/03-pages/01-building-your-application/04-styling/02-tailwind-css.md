# Tailwind CSS

Style your Next.js Application using Tailwind CSS.

## Introduction

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs without leaving your HTML. It provides low-level utility classes that let you create complex designs directly in your markup.

## Installation

To install Tailwind CSS in your Next.js application, follow these steps:

1. Install Tailwind CSS via npm:

   ```
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   ```

2. Create a `tailwind.config.js` file:

   ```
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```

3. Configure your `tailwind.config.js` file:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     content: [
       "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
       "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
     ],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [],
   }
   ```

4. Add Tailwind to your CSS by including the following lines in your `globals.css` or equivalent file:

   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

## Usage

You can now use Tailwind CSS classes in your components. For example:

```jsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-screen bg-gray-100">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-blue-500">Hello, Tailwind CSS!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Customization

Tailwind CSS is highly customizable. You can extend the default theme in your `tailwind.config.js` file to add custom colors, spacing, and more.

## Conclusion

Using Tailwind CSS with Next.js allows for rapid UI development with a focus on utility classes. For more advanced usage and features, refer to the official Tailwind CSS documentation.
