# Instrumentation

Learn how to use instrumentation to run code at server startup in your Next.js app.

## Overview

Instrumentation allows you to execute code during the server startup phase of your Next.js application. This can be useful for initializing resources, setting up logging, or performing other setup tasks.

## Usage

To implement instrumentation in your Next.js app, follow these steps:

1. **Create a file for instrumentation**: You can create a dedicated file for your instrumentation logic. This file should export a function that will be called during server startup.

2. **Export the function**: Ensure that the function you create is exported so that Next.js can invoke it.

3. **Use the function in your application**: You can import and call this function in your server entry point or any other appropriate location in your application.

## Example

Here is a simple example of how to set up instrumentation:

```javascript
// instrumentation.js
export function initialize() {
  console.log('Server is starting up...');
  // Add your initialization logic here
}
```

Then, in your server entry point:

```javascript
import { initialize } from './instrumentation';

initialize();
```

## Best Practices

- Keep your instrumentation code modular and focused on specific tasks.
- Avoid heavy computations or blocking operations during startup to ensure a fast server response.
- Log important events to monitor the server's behavior during startup.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively use instrumentation to enhance your Next.js application's startup process.
