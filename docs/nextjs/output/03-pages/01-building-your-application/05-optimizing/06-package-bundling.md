# Optimizing Bundling

Learn how to optimize your application's server and client bundles.

## Overview

Optimizing your application's bundling is crucial for improving performance and reducing load times. This guide provides strategies for both server and client-side optimizations.

## Server Bundle Optimization

1. **Code Splitting**: Break your server code into smaller chunks to load only what is necessary.
2. **Tree Shaking**: Remove unused code from your bundles to reduce size.
3. **Minification**: Compress your code to decrease file size and improve load times.

## Client Bundle Optimization

1. **Lazy Loading**: Load components only when they are needed to improve initial load time.
2. **Bundle Analysis**: Use tools to analyze your bundle size and identify large dependencies.
3. **Caching**: Implement caching strategies to reduce the need for repeated downloads.
