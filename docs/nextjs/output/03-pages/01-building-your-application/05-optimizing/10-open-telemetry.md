# OpenTelemetry

Learn how to instrument your Next.js app with OpenTelemetry.

## Overview

OpenTelemetry is a set of APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation to provide observability for applications. It helps in collecting metrics, logs, and traces from your application.

## Instrumentation Steps

1. **Install OpenTelemetry Packages**: Use the package manager to install the necessary OpenTelemetry packages for your Next.js application.

2. **Initialize OpenTelemetry**: Set up the OpenTelemetry SDK in your application. This typically involves configuring the tracer and exporter.

3. **Add Instrumentation**: Instrument your application code to capture traces and metrics. This can include HTTP requests, database queries, and other significant operations.

4. **Export Data**: Configure the exporter to send the collected data to your preferred observability platform.

5. **Verify Data Collection**: Ensure that the data is being collected and sent correctly by checking your observability platform.

## Best Practices

- Keep your instrumentation lightweight to avoid performance overhead.
- Use context propagation to maintain trace context across asynchronous calls.
- Regularly update your OpenTelemetry dependencies to benefit from the latest features and fixes.
