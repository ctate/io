# Introduction

Welcome to the Next.js documentation!

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations. It abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed for React, like bundling and compiling, allowing you to focus on building your application.

## Main Features

Some of the main Next.js features include:

- **Routing**: A file-system based router built on top of Server Components that supports layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.
- **Rendering**: Client-side and Server-side Rendering with Client and Server Components, optimized with Static and Dynamic Rendering on the server, and streaming on Edge and Node.js runtimes.
- **Data Fetching**: Simplified data fetching with async/await in Server Components, and an extended fetch API for request memoization, data caching, and revalidation.
- **Styling**: Support for preferred styling methods, including CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and CSS-in-JS.
- **Optimizations**: Image, Fonts, and Script Optimizations to improve your application's Core Web Vitals and User Experience.
- **TypeScript**: Improved support for TypeScript, with better type checking, efficient compilation, and custom TypeScript Plugin and type checker.

## How to Use These Docs

The docs navbar on the left organizes pages sequentially from basic to advanced. You can read them in any order or skip to relevant pages. The right side features a table of contents for easier navigation, and a search bar for quick access.

To get started, check out the Installation guide.

## App Router vs Pages Router

Next.js has two routers: the App Router and the Pages Router. The App Router allows the use of React's latest features, while the Pages Router is the original router for server-rendered applications. A dropdown menu at the top of the sidebar lets you switch between the two, and breadcrumbs indicate which docs you are viewing.

## Pre-Requisite Knowledge

While the docs are beginner-friendly, a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and React is recommended. For React fundamentals, consider the React Foundations Course, and learn more about Next.js by building a dashboard application.

## Accessibility

For optimal accessibility with screen readers, use Firefox and NVDA, or Safari and VoiceOver.
