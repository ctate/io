# Building Your Application

Next.js provides the building blocks to create flexible, full-stack web applications. The guides in Building Your Application explain how to use these features and how to customize your application's behavior.

The sections and pages are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, allowing you to follow them step-by-step when building your Next.js application. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case.

If you're new to Next.js, we recommend starting with the following sections, as they introduce fundamental Next.js and web concepts to help you get started:

- Routing
- Rendering
- Data Fetching
- Styling

Afterward, you can explore deeper topics such as Optimizing and Configuring. Finally, once you're ready, check out the Deploying and Upgrading sections.
