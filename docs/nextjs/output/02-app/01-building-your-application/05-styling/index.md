# Styling

Next.js supports different ways of styling your application, including:

### 1. CSS Modules
Create locally scoped CSS classes to avoid naming conflicts and improve maintainability.

### 2. Global CSS
Simple to use and familiar for those experienced with traditional CSS, but can lead to larger CSS bundles and difficulty managing styles as the application grows.

### 3. Tailwind CSS
A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid custom designs by composing utility classes.

### 4. Sass
A popular CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.

### 5. CSS-in-JS
Embed CSS directly in your JavaScript components, enabling dynamic and scoped styling.
