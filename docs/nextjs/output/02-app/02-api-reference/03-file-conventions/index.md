# File Conventions

## Overview

This document outlines the conventions for special files in Next.js, which are essential for the framework's functionality.

## Special Files

1. **pages/**: This directory contains the application's routes. Each file corresponds to a route based on its file name.

2. **public/**: Static assets like images and fonts should be placed here. Files in this directory can be accessed directly via the base URL.

3. **api/**: This folder is used for API routes. Each file in this directory is treated as an API endpoint.

4. **_app.js**: This file is used to initialize pages. It can be used to persist layout between page changes and keep state when navigating.

5. **_document.js**: This file is used to augment the application's HTML and can be used to modify the `<html>` and `<body>` tags.

6. **_error.js**: This file is used to handle errors in the application. It allows for custom error pages.

7. **.env**: Environment variables can be defined in this file. It is used to configure the application without hardcoding sensitive information.

8. **next.config.js**: This file is used to customize the Next.js configuration. It allows for various settings and optimizations.

## Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for file names.
- Use descriptive names that reflect the content or purpose of the file.
- Avoid using special characters or spaces in file names.

## Best Practices

- Keep the directory structure organized and intuitive.
- Regularly review and refactor files to maintain clarity and efficiency.
- Document any custom configurations or conventions used in the project.

## Conclusion

Following these conventions will help maintain a clean and efficient codebase in Next.js applications.
