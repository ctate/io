# Imports Sorting

Biome allows sorting import statements using [natural ordering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order).

This feature is enabled by default but can be opted-out via configuration:

```json
{
  "organizeImports": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

The import sorter doesn't remove unused imports. We provide the linter rule [noUnusedImports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order) with a safe fix that removes unused imports.

## How imports are sorted

Import statements are sorted by "distance". Modules that are "farther" from the user are put on the top, modules "closer" to the user are put on the bottom:

1. modules imported via `bun:` protocol. This is applicable when writing code run by Bun;
1. built-in Node.js modules that are explicitly imported using the `node:` protocol and common Node built-ins such as `assert`;
1. modules imported via `npm:` protocol. This is applicable when writing code run by Deno;
1. modules that contain the protocol `:`. These are usually considered "virtual modules", modules that are injected by your working environment, e.g. `vite`;
1. modules imported via URL;
1. modules imported from libraries;
1. modules imported via absolute imports;
1. modules imported from a name prefixed by `#`. This is applicable when using [Node's subpath imports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-imports);
1. modules imported via relative imports;
1. modules that couldn't be identified by the previous criteria;

For example, given the following code:

```ts
import uncle from "../uncle";
import sibling from "./sibling";
import express from "npm:express";
import imageUrl from "url:./image.png";
import { sortBy } from "virtual:utils";
import assert from "node:assert";
import aunt from "../aunt";
import { VERSION } from "https://deno.land/std/version.ts";
import { mock, test } from "node:test";
import { expect } from "bun:test";
import { internal } from "#internal";
import { secret } from "/absolute/path";
import React from "react";
```

They will be sorted like this:

```ts
import { expect } from "bun:test";
import assert from "node:assert";
import { mock, test } from "node:test";
import express from "npm:express";
import { sortBy } from "virtual:utils";
import { VERSION } from "https://deno.land/std/version.ts";
import React from "react";
import { secret } from "/absolute/path";
import { internal } from "#internal";
import aunt from "../aunt";
import uncle from "../uncle";
import sibling from "./sibling";
import imageUrl from "url:./image.png";
```

## Grouped imports

It's widespread to have import statements in a certain order, primarily when you work on a frontend project, and you import CSS files:

```js
import "../styles/reset.css";
import "../styles/layout.css";
import { Grid } from "../components/Grid.jsx";
```

Another common case is import polyfills or shim files, that needs to stay at the top file:

```js
import "../polyfills/array/flatMap";
import { functionThatUsesFlatMap } from "./utils.js";
```

In these cases, Biome will sort all these three imports, and it might happen that the order will **break** your application.

To avoid this, create a "group" of imports. You create a "group" by adding a **new line** to separate the groups.

By doing so, Biome will limit the sorting only to the import statements that belong to the same group:

```js
// group 1, only these two files will be sorted
import "../styles/reset.css";
import "../styles/layout.css";

// group 2, only this one is sorted
import { Grid } from "../components/Grid.jsx";
```

```js
// group 1, the polyfill/shim
import "../polyfills/array/flatMap";

// group 2, the files that require the polyfill/shim
import { functionThatUsesFlatMap } from "./utils.js";
```

## Side effect imports

[Side effect imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#forms_of_import_declarations) are import statements that usually don't import any name:

```js
import "./global.js"
```

Since it is difficult to determine which side effects a module triggers, the import sorter assumes that each side effect import forms its own import group.

For example, the following imports form 4 import groups.

```js
import sibling from "./sibling";       // Import group 1
import { internal } from "#internal";  // Import group 1
import "z";  // Import group 2
import "a";  // Import group 3
import React from "react";         // Import group 4
import assert from "node:assert";  // Import group 4
```

Each group is independently sorted as follows:

```js
import { internal } from "#internal";  // Import group 1
import sibling from "./sibling";      // Import group 1
import "z";  // Import group 2
import "a";  // Import group 3
import assert from "node:assert";  // Import group 4
import React from "react";         // Import group 4
```

## Import sorting via CLI

Using the command `check`, with the option `--write`. If you want only order the imports, you can use check like so:

```shell
biome check \
    --formatter-enabled=false\
    --linter-enabled=false \
    --organize-imports-enabled=true \
    --write \
    ./path/to/src
```

## Import sorting via VSCode extension

The Biome VS Code extension supports imports sorting through the "Organize Imports" code action.
By default, this action can be run using the <kbd title="Shift">‚áß</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> keyboard shortcut, or is accessible through the _Command Palette_ (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd title="Cmd">‚åò</kbd>+<kbd title="Shift">‚áß</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) by selecting _Organize Imports_.

You can add the following to your editor configuration if you want the action to run automatically on save instead of calling it manually:

```json
{
	"editor.codeActionsOnSave":{
		"source.organizeImports.biome": "explicit"
	}
}
```

# Analyzer

Biome's analyzer intends to provide a series of features that users can leverage.

For now, it only provides import sorting that sorts import statements in JavaScript-like files.

# Differences with Prettier

In some cases, Biome has intentionally decided to format code in a way that doesn't match Prettier's output. These divergences are explained below.

## Prettier doesn't unquote some object properties that are valid JavaScript identifiers.

Prettier and Biome unquote object and class properties that are valid JavaScript identifiers. Prettier [unquotes only valid ES5 identifiers](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/blob/a5d502513e5de4819a41fd90b9be7247146effc7/src/language-js/utils/index.js#L646).

This is a legacy restriction in an ecosystem where ES2015 is now widespread. Thus, we decided to diverge here by un-quoting all valid JavaScript identifiers in ES2015+.

A possible workaround would be to introduce a configuration to set the ECMAScript version a project uses. We could then adjust the un-quoting behaviour based on that version. Setting the ECMAScript version to `ES5` could match Prettier's behaviour.

```javascript
const obj = {
  'a': true,
  b: true,
  "êäß": true,
}
```

Diff

```javascript
const obj = {
  a: true,
  b: true,
  "êäß": true,
  êäß: true,
};
```

## Prettier has an inconsistent behavior for assignment in computed keys.

Prettier and Biome enclose some assignment expressions between parentheses, particularly in conditionals. This allows Biome to identify an expression that should be a comparison.

Prettier has inconsistent behaviour because it adds parentheses for an assignment in a computed key of an object property and doesn't for a computed key of a class property, as demonstrated by the following example:

Input

```javascript
a = {
  [x = 0]: 1,
}

class C {
  [x = 0] = 1
}
```

Diff

```javascript
a = {
  [(x = 0)]: 1,
  [x = 0]: 1,
};

class C {
  [x = 0] = 1;
}
```

To be consistent, we decided to diverge and omit the parentheses. Alternatively, we could enclose any assignment in a computed key of an object or of a class.

## Prettier adds a trailing comma to type parameters of arrow functions even when it is not required.

In some specific cases, a type parameter list of an arrow function requires a trailing comma to distinguish it from a JSX element. When a default type is provided, this trailing comma is not required. Here, we diverge from Prettier because we think it better respects the original intent of Prettier, which was to add a trailing comma only when required.

Input

```typescript
<T = unknown>() => {};
```

Diff

```typescript
<T = unknown,>() => {};
<T = unknown>() => {};
```

## Prettier has an inconsistent behavior for parenthesized non-null-asserted optional chains

In _TypeScript_, the non-null assertion operator `!` allows asserting that a value is non-null. When applied on an optional chain, the assertion applies to the entire chain regardless of the presence of parentheses, making equivalent `(a.?.b)!` and `a.?.b!`.

The previous code examples are already well-formatted, according to Prettier. Prettier is used to enforce the presence or the absence of parentheses. This looks like a missed opportunity to normalize the code.

Moreover, Prettier doesn't remove the parentheses even when they enclose the non-null assertion. Instead, it moves the operator outside the parentheses.

Input:

```typescript
a.?.b!
(a.?.b)!
(a.?.b!)
```

Diff

```typescript
a.?.b!
(a.?.b)!
a.?.b!
(a.?.b!)
a.?.b!
```

## Prettier formats invalid syntaxes

Prettier's Babel-based parsing for JavaScript and TypeScript is very loose and [allows multiple errors](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/blob/e4a74c05f4502dd4ec70495c3130ff08ab088e05/src/language-js/parse/babel.js#L177-L218) to be ignored. Biome's parser is intentionally stricter than the Prettier parser. It correctly identifies the following syntax errors:

- A function cannot have duplicate modifiers
- invalid order of properties' modifiers
- Function declarations are not allowed to have bodies
- non-abstract classes cannot have abstract properties
- An optional chain cannot be assigned
- The `const` modifier cannot be set on a type parameter of an interface
- top-level return
- etc.

In Prettier, these errors aren't considered parse errors, and the AST is still built "correctly" with the appropriate nodes. When formatting, Prettier treats these nodes as normal and formats them accordingly.

In Biome, the parsing errors result in `Bogus` nodes, which may contain any number of valid nodes, invalid nodes, and/or raw characters. When formatting, Biome treats bogus nodes as effectively plain text, printing them out verbatim into the resulting code without any formatting since attempting to format them could be incorrect and cause semantic changes.

For class properties, Prettier's current parsing strategy also uses boolean fields for modifiers, meaning only one of each kind of modifier can ever be present (accessibility modifiers are stored as a single string). When printing, Prettier looks at the list of booleans and decides which modifiers to print out again. Biome instead keeps a list of modifiers, meaning duplicates are kept around and can be analyzed (hence the parsing error messages about duplicate modifiers and ordering). When printing out the bogus nodes, this list is kept intact, and printing out the unformatted text results in those modifiers continuing to exist.

There are ways that Biome can address this. One possibility is to try to interpret the Bogus nodes when formatting and construct valid nodes out of them. If a valid node can be built, then it would just format that node like normal, otherwise, it prints the bogus text verbatim as it does currently. However, this is messy and introduces a form of parsing logic into the formatter that is not meaningful.

Another option is to introduce some form of "syntactically-valid bogus node" into the parser, which accepts these kinds of purely semantic errors (duplicate modifiers, abstract properties in non-abstract classes).

It would continue to build the nodes like normal (effectively matching the behavior in Prettier) but store them inside of a new kind of bogus node, including the diagnostics along with it. When formatting, these particular bogus nodes would just attempt to format the inner node and then fallback if there's an error (the existing `format_or_verbatim` utility would do this already). This keeps the parsing and formatting logic separate from each other but introduces more complexity to the parser, allowing invalid states to be considered semi-valid.

### Duplicate modifiers on class properties

Input

```typescript
// Multiple accessibility modifiers
class Foo {
  private public a  = 1;
}

// Declare function with body
declare function foo ( ) {  }

// Invalid use of abstract
class Bar {
  abstract  foo  ;
}

// Duplicate Readonly
class Read {
  readonly readonly   x: number;
}
```

Diff

```typescript
// Multiple accessibility modifiers
class Foo {
  private public a  = 1;
  private a = 1;
}

// Declare function with body
declare function foo ( ) {  }
declare function foo() {};

// Invalid use of abstract
class Bar {
  abstract  foo  ;
  abstract foo;
}

// Duplicate Readonly
class Read {
  readonly readonly   x: number;
  readonly x: number;
}
```

### Assignment to an optional chain

Input

```javascript
(a?.b) = c;
```

Diff

```javascript
a?.b = c;
(a?.b) = c;
```

### Incorrect modifier for the type parameters of an interface

Input

```typescript
interface L<in const T> {}
```

Diff

```typescript
interface L<const in T> {}
interface L<in const T> {}
```

### Top-level return

```javascript
return someVeryLongStringA && someVeryLongStringB && someVeryLongStringC && someVeryLongStringD
```

```javascript
return someVeryLongStringA && someVeryLongStringB && someVeryLongStringC && someVeryLongStringD
return (
  someVeryLongStringA &&
  someVeryLongStringB &&
  someVeryLongStringC &&
  someVeryLongStringD
);
```

### Erroneous self-increment and self-decrement

Input

```javascript
(1)++;
```

```javascript
1++;
(1)++;
```

### Use of `abstract` modifier in non-abstract classes

Input

```typescript
class C {
  abstract f() : number;
}
```

Diff


```typescript
class C {
  abstract f(): number;
  abstract f() : number;
}
```

## Prettier has inconsistencies between TypeScript and Babel parsing

Prettier supports a number of different parsers for JavaScript and TypeScript code, all of which are meant to be compatible with the [`estree` spec](https://github.com/estree/estree). Most of the time, Prettier uses Babel as the default parser for JavaScript code, but when parsing TypeScript, it will try to use TypeScript's own parser first and only fall back to Babel with TypeScript enabled afterward. While the TypeScript parser is generally compatible with `estree`, it's not exact, and [this can lead to some inconsistencies](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/15785) that affect the output that Prettier creates. In general, these are considered bugs in Prettier itself, since the output should be the same regardless of which parser is used.

Biome implements its own parsing that handles all forms of JavaScript and TypeScript code, meaning there should not be any inconsistencies between the two. However, when migrating a TypeScript codebase from Prettier to Biome, it's possible that some formatting will appear to have changed because of those discrepancies between parsers from Prettier.

These cases are not considered bugs or incompatibilities in Biome. If formatted code only appears different using the `typescript` parser setting in Prettier, but matches when using `babel` and/or `babel-ts`, then Biome considers the output to be compatible.

As an example, consider this case, formatted using Biome and Prettier 3.1.0 with the `typescript` parser:

Input

```typescript
function someFunctionName(
  someLongBreakingParameterName,
  anotherLongParameterName,
) {
  return isEqual(a?.map(([t, _]) => t?.id), b?.map(([t, _]) => t?.id));
}
```

Diff


```typescript
function someFunctionName(
  someLongBreakingParameterName,
  anotherLongParameterName,
) {
  return isEqual(a?.map(([t, _]) => t?.id), b?.map(([t, _]) => t?.id));
  return isEqual(
    a?.map(([t, _]) => t?.id),
    b?.map(([t, _]) => t?.id),
  );
}
```

Prettier with the TypeScript parser chooses to write the `isEqual` call on a single line, while Biome matches the output of Prettier with the `babel` and `babel-ts` parsers. As such, this is _not_ considered an incompatibility with Biome and is instead considered a bug in Prettier.

# Formatter

Biome is an opinionated formatter that [supports multiple languages](https://github.com/biome-sh/biome).
It follows a similar [philosophy to Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/option-philosophy.html),
only supporting a few options to avoid debates over styles, turning into debates over Biome options.
It deliberately [resists the urge to add new options](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/40) to prevent [bike-shed discussions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) in teams so they can focus on what really matters instead.

## CLI

The following command checks the formatting of the files in the `src` directory.
It emits text differences if it finds code that is not formatted.

```shell
biome format ./src
```

If you want to **apply** the new formatting, pass the `--write` option:

```shell
biome format --write ./src
```

The command accepts a list of files and directories.

### Caution

If you pass a glob as a parameter, your shell will expand it.
The result of the expansion depends on your shell.
For example, some shells don't support the recursive glob `**` or the alternation `{}` in the following command:

```shell
biome format ./src/**/*.test.{js,ts}
```

Shell expansion has a performance cost and a limit on the number of files you can pass to the command.

## Options

Biome provides some options to tune the behavior of its formatter.
Differently from other tools, Biome separates language-agnostic options from language-specific options.

The formatter options can be set on the CLI or via a Biome configuration file.
As of v1.9, Biome supports loading `.editorconfig` files.

It's recommended to use a Biome configuration file to ensure that both the Biome CLI and the Biome LSP apply the same options.
The following defaults are applied:

```json
{
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "formatWithErrors": false,
    "ignore": [],
    "attributePosition": "auto",
    "indentStyle": "tab",
    "indentWidth": 2,
    "lineWidth": 80,
    "lineEnding": "lf"
  },
  "javascript": {
    "formatter": {
      "arrowParentheses":"always",
      "bracketSameLine": false,
      "bracketSpacing": true,
      "jsxQuoteStyle": "double",
      "quoteProperties": "asNeeded",
      "semicolons": "always",
      "trailingCommas": "all"
    }
  },
  "json": {
    "formatter": {
      "trailingCommas": "none"
    }
  }
}
```

The main language-agnostic options supported by the Biome formatter are:

- indent style (default: `tab`): Use spaces or tabs for indention;
- indent width (default: `2`): The number of spaces per indention level.
- line width (default: `80`): The column width at which Biome wraps code;

## Ignore Code

There are times when the formatted code isn't ideal.

For these cases, you can use a format suppression comment:

```js
// biome-ignore format: <explanation>
```

Example:

```js
const expr =
  // biome-ignore format: the array should not be formatted
  [
    (2 * n) / (r - l),
    0,
    (r + l) / (r - l),
    0,
    0,
    (2 * n) / (t - b),
    (t + b) / (t - b),
    0,
    0,
    0,
    -(f + n) / (f - n),
    -(2 * f * n) / (f - n),
    0,
    0,
    -1,
    0,
  ];
```

# Formatter Option Philosophy

Biome follows the same [Option Philosophy as Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/option-philosophy). The existing set of options for formatting is considered stable, and new options are not likely to be considered.

Biome is an opinionated formatter. In an ideal world, that means Biome assumes there is only one correct way to format things and will enforce that style at all times. No matter the project, no matter the setup, code formatted by Biome will always look the same. From another perspective, Biome is its own automatic style guide, not a tool for implementing other style guides.

Having such a strong opinion on formatting may seem heavy-handed, but the benefits quickly become clear after adoption. All of the discussions about where spaces should go, whether a line should be broken out, whether a line should be indented, and so many more simply vanish. [Trivial, bike-shedding discussions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) no longer distract from focusing on what matters. Code reviews become free of re-formatting requests and cyclical debates. All it takes is trust that Biome does its best to format code cleanly, legibly, and consistently.

Beyond the benefits within individual teams and organizations, the adoption of consistent formatters across the whole web ecosystem benefits everyone, making it easier to retain familiarity when moving between projects and helping newcomers learn and recognize patterns more intuitively without distractions.

In the web ecosystem today, Prettier is by far the most popular code formatter, and it is also strongly opinionated, with a [strict philosophy on adding options](https://prettier.io/docs/en/option-philosophy). Biome aims to be largely compatible with Prettier, and as such, has adopted many of the opinions that Prettier implements, and configuration is no exception to that.

Biome is proud to have reached such high compatibility with Prettier and make the migration path for users as painless as possible, but this also comes with similar caveats.

## Existing Options

Biome started out with a strict subset of configuration options, targeting the most common and contentious style guidelines in the JavaScript ecosystem: indent styles (tabs vs spaces), indent widths (2 spaces to equal a tab, or 4?), and enforced semicolons. Adding options for these points was considered sufficient enough to address most people‚Äôs needs, and there was no strong consideration for adding any others.

Leaning on the [Prettier Option Philosophy](https://prettier.io/docs/en/option-philosophy), Biome had the chance to start fresh and avoid the pitfalls that Prettier had fallen into with its other existing options, like `--bracket-same-line` and `--arrow-parens`:

‚Ä¶[these] are not the type of options we‚Äôre happy to have. They cause a lot of bike-shedding in teams, and we‚Äôre sorry for that. Difficult to remove now, these options exist as a historical artifact and should not motivate adding more options (‚ÄúIf *those* options exist, why can‚Äôt this one?‚Äù).

However, when the [Prettier Challenge was announced](https://twitter.com/Vjeux/status/1722733472522142022), Biome decided to accept the challenge, which required implementing all of the configuration options that Prettier had to achieve full compatibility.

Biome still shares Prettier's philosophy about these options and considers them a legacy feature for compatibility rather than a baseline feature set. Their existence does not indicate that more options will be added, nor should they be used as a rationale to support the existence of other options in the future.

## New Options

Much like Prettier, Biome believes the current set of options is stable, sufficient, and not open for additions or other changes. Requests for additional configuration options are not likely to be considered and may be closed without discussion.

That said, even as Biome has established itself as a capable and robust formatting tool, it is also still relatively new, meaning there is plenty of opportunity to pave the way for new advancements and ideas that may not seem feasible otherwise.

The formatting style of Biome is also considered relatively stable, continuing to match Prettier as much as possible, with [few intentional deviations](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/739). Changes to the style of Biome may be considered and implemented. Still, these are also unlikely to become configurable options and would instead be applied universally for all future versions of Biome.

# Use Biome in Big Projects

Biome can provide some tools that can help you to use it properly in big projects, such as monorepo or workspaces that contain multiple projects.

## Use Multiple Configuration Files

When you use Biome's features - either with the CLI or LSP - the tool looks for the nearest configuration file using the current working directory.

If Biome doesn't find the configuration file there, it **starts walking upwards** the directories of the file system, until it finds one.

You can leverage this feature to apply different settings based on the project/folder.

Let's suppose we have a project that contains a backend app and new frontend app.

```
- app
  - backend
    - biome.json
    - package.json
  - frontend
    - biome.json
    - legacy-app
      - package.json
    - new-app
      - package.json
```

This means that when you run a script from the file `app/backend/package.json`, Biome will use the configuration file `app/backend/biome.json`.

When you run a script from `app/frontend/legacy-app/package.json` or `app/frontend/new-app/package.json`, Biome will use the configuration file `app/frontend/biome.json`.

## Share the Configuration

It's possible to use the `extends` configuration option to breakdown options across files.

Let's assume that we have these requirements:
- `legacy-app` have to format using spaces;
- `backend` and `new-app` have to format using tabs;
- all apps have to format using line width 120;
- `backend` app needs some extra linting;

We start by creating a new configuration file at `app/biome.json`, and put there the shared options:

```json
{
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "lineWidth": 120
  }
}
```

Now let's **move** `app/frontend/biome.json` to `app/frontend/legacy-app/`, because that's where we need to use a different formatting.

```json
{
  "extends": ["../../biome.json"],
  "formatter": {
    "indentStyle": "space"
  }
}
```

Then, we tell Biome to inherit all the options from the main `app/biome.json` file, using the `extends` property.

Let's jump to `app/backend/biome.json`, where we need to enable the linting:

```json
{
  "extends": ["../biome.json"],
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Monorepos

Monorepos are particular repositories where multiple libraries are stored and maintained in one big repository. Each library represents a self-contained project, which can contain different configurations.

Biome doesn't support monorepos very well due to some limitations in resolving nested configuration files, you can [help and follow the relative issue](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2228).

In order to have the best developer experience despite the current limitation, it's advised to have a `biome.json` at the root of the monorepo, and use the `overrides` configuration to change the behaviour of Biome in certain packages.

In the following example we disable the rule `suspicious/noConsoleLog` inside the package `packages/logger`.

```json
{
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true
    }
  },
  "overrides": [{
      "include": ["packages/logger/**"],
      "linter": {
        "rules": {
          "suspicious": {
            "noConsoleLog": "off"
          }
        }
      }
  }]
}
```

# Configure Biome

## Introduction

This guide will help you understand how to configure Biome. It explains the structure of a Biome configuration file and how Biome resolves its configuration.

## Configuration File Structure

A Biome configuration file is named `biome.json` or `biome.jsonc`. It is usually placed in your project's root directory, next to your project's `package.json`.

Biome's configuration is organized around the tools it provides. At the moment, Biome provides three tools: the formatter, the linter, and the import sorter (also called the import organizer). All of these tools are enabled by default. You can disable one or several of them using the `<tool>.enabled` field:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/1.9.4/schema.json",
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "linter": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "organizeImports": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

Options that apply to more than one language are placed in the corresponding tool field. Language-specific options of a tool are placed under a `<language>.<tool>` field. This also allows overriding general options for a given language. You can also enable or disable a tool based on the language.

```json5
{
  "formatter": {
    "indentStyle": "space", // default is `tab`
    "lineWidth": 100 // default is `80`
  },
  "javascript": {
    "formatter": {
      "quoteStyle": "single", // default is `double`
      "lineWidth": 120 // override `formatter.lineWidth`
    }
  },
  "json": {
    "formatter": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

Note: Biome refers to all variants of the JavaScript language as `javascript`. This includes TypeScript, JSX, and TSX.

## Configuration File Resolution

Biome uses auto-discovery to find the nearest configuration file. It looks in the working directory and in the parent directories until it finds a `biome.json` or a `biome.jsonc` file. If no configuration is found, then it applies Biome's defaults. If both `biome.json` and `biome.jsonc` are present in the same folder, the priority will be given to `biome.json`.

Here's an example:

- Biome commands that run in `app/backend/package.json` will use the configuration file `app/backend/biome.json`;
- Biome commands that run in `app/frontend/legacy/package.json` and `app/frontend/new/package.json` will use the configuration file `app/frontend/biome.json`;

Note: Biome doesn't support nested `biome.json` files, neither in CLI nor in LSP. [Follow and help the support in the related issue](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2228)

Note: Biome commands support using the `--config-path` option and the `BIOME_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable. This allows you to specify a custom configuration file or a directory where Biome can look for a `biome.json` or `biome.jsonc` file. When you use `--config-path` or `BIOME_CONFIG_PATH`, the standard configuration file resolution process is **disabled**.

If `--config-path` or `BIOME_CONFIG_PATH` points directly to a file, you can use names other than `biome.json` or `biome.jsonc`. Biome will read a `.json` file using a standard JSON parser. For files with other extensions, Biome will treat them as `.jsonc` files, using a more flexible JSON parser that allows comments and trailing commas.

## Share a Configuration File

The `extends` field allows you to split your configuration across multiple files. This way, you can share common settings across different projects or folders.

Here's an example of how you might set up your configuration to extend a `common.json` configuration file:

```json
{
  "extends": ["./common.json"]
}
```

The entries defined in `extends` are resolved from the path where the `biome.json` file is defined. They are processed in the order they are listed, with settings in later files overriding earlier ones.

Biome is able to resolve configuration files from the `node_modules/` directory. So you can export your configuration file from a package, and import it in multiple projects.

In order to do so, the first thing to do is to set up your "shared" Biome configuration in a certain way. Let's suppose that you want to share a configuration from a package called `@org/shared-configs`, using the specifier `@org/shared-configs/biome`. You have to create an `exports` entry in the `package.json` of this package:

```json
{
  "name": "@org/shared-configs",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
    "./biome": "./biome.json"
  }
}
```

Make sure that `@org/shared-configs` is correctly installed in your project, and update the `biome.json` file to look like the following snippet:

```json
{
  "extends": ["@org/shared-configs/biome"]
}
```

Biome will attempt to **resolve** your library `@org/shared-configs/` from your working directory. The working directory is:

- when using the CLI, the directory where you execute your scripts from. Usually, it matches the location of your `package.json` file;
- when using the LSP, the root directory of your project.

Note: To avoid a breaking change with how the existing resolution works, paths starting with a dot `.` or ending with `.json` or `.jsonc` **won't** be resolved from `node_modules/`.

For more information about the resolution algorithm, refer to the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#resolution-and-loading-algorithm).

## Ignore Files

The first way to control which files and directories are processed by Biome is to list them in the CLI. In the following command, we format only `file1.js` and all the files in the `src` directory. The directories are recursively traversed.

```shell
biome format file1.js src/
```

Note: Glob patterns used on the command line are not interpreted by Biome. They are expanded by your shell. Some shells don't support the recursive glob `**`.

The Biome configuration file can be used to refine which files are processed. You can explicitly list the files to be processed using `include` and the files not to be processed using `ignore`. `include` and `ignore` accept globs patterns such as `src/**/*.js`. See the [related section](#glob-syntax-explained) for which glob syntaxes are supported. `include` is always applied first before applying `ignore`. This allows you to include some files and to ignore some of the file you included.

Note: `include` and `ignore` have a slightly different semantics:
- for `ignore`: if a file matches the globs, **_don't_ apply** the configuration inside this override, and keep apply the next overrides;
- for `include`: if a file matches the globs, **apply** the configuration inside this override, and keep apply the next overrides;

Biome provides global `files.include` and `files.ignore` fields that apply to all tools. You can also include and ignore files at tool level using `<tool>.include` and `<tool>.ignore`. Note that they don't override the global `files.include` and `files.ignore`. `files.include` and `files.ignore` are applied first before a tool's `include` and `ignore`.

Let's take the following configuration:

```json
{
  "files": {
    "include": ["src/**/*.js", "test/**/*.js"],
    "ignore": ["**/*.min.js"],
  },
  "linter": {
    "ignore": ["test"]
  }
}
```

And run the following command:

```shell
biome format test/
```

The command will format the files that end with the `.js` extension and doesn't end with the `.min.js` extension from the `test` directory. The files in `src` are not formatted because the directory is not listed in the CLI.

If we run the following command, no files are linted because the `test` directory is explicitly ignored for the linter.

```shell
biome lint test/
```

Biome resolves the globs relatively from the working directory. The working directory is the directory where you usually run a CLI command. This means that you have to place **particular attention** when the configuration file is placed in a different directory from where you execute your command. In the case of an editor (LSP) the working directory is the root directory of your project.

Let's take a project that contains two directories `backend/` and `frontend/`, and the Biome configuration file that we introduced earlier. Inside the `frontend/` directory, a `package.json` specifies a `format` script that runs the Biome formatter.

```json
{
  "name": "frontend-project",
  "scripts": {
    "format": "biome format --write ./"
  }
}
```

When you run the script `format` from `frontend/package.json`, the working directory resolved by that script will be `frontend/`. The globs `src/**/*.js` and `test/**/*.js` will have as "base" directory `frontend/`. Thus, only the files from `frontend/src/` and `frontend/test/` will be formatted.

```json
{
  "files": {
    "include": ["src/**/*.js", "src/**/*.ts"],
    "ignore": ["test"]
  },
  "formatter": {
    "indentStyle": "space"
  }
}
```

Note: `ignore` and `include` inside `overrides` have a **different** semantics:
- for `ignore`: if a file matches the globs, **_don't_ apply** the configuration inside this override, and keep apply the next overrides;
- for `include`: if a file matches the globs, **apply** the configuration inside this override, and keep apply the next overrides;

Note: By default, Biome always ignores some files that are said to be **protected files**. This means that no diagnostics will be ever emitted by Biome for those files. At the moment, the following files are protected:

- `composer.lock`
- `npm-shrinkwrap.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `yarn.lock`

Note: You can also [ignore files ignored by your VCS](/guides/integrate-in-vcs#use-the-ignore-file).

## Well-known Files

Here are some well-known files that we specifically treat based on their file names, rather than their extensions. Currently, the well-known files are JSON-like files only, but we may broaden the list to include other types when we support new parsers.

The following files are parsed as `JSON` files with both the options `json.parser.allowComments` and `json.parser.allowTrailingCommas` set to `false`.

- `.all-contributorsrc`
- `.arcconfig`
- `.auto-changelog`
- `.bowerrc`
- `.c8rc`
- `.htmlhintrc`
- `.imgbotconfig`
- `.jslintrc`
- `.nycrc`
- `.tern-config`
- `.tern-project`
- `.vuerc`
- `.watchmanconfig`
- `mcmod.info`

The following files are parsed as `JSON` files with the options `json.parser.allowComments` set to `true` but `json.parser.allowTrailingCommas` set to `false`. This is because the tools consuming these files can only strip comments.

- `.ember-cli`
- `.eslintrc.json`
- `.jscsrc`
- `.jshintrc`
- `tslint.json`
- `turbo.json`

The following files are parsed as `JSON` files with the options `json.parser.allowComments` and `json.parser.allowTrailingCommas` set to `true`. This is because the tools consuming these files are designed to accommodate such settings.

- `.babelrc`
- `.babelrc.json`
- `.devcontainer.json`
- `.hintrc`
- `.hintrc.json`
- `.swcrc`
- `api-documenter.json`
- `api-extractor.json`
- `babel.config.json`
- `deno.json`
- `devcontainer.json`
- `dprint.json`
- `jsconfig.json`
- `jsr.json`
- `language-configuration.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `typedoc.json`
- `typescript.json`

## Glob Syntax Explained

A glob pattern specifies a set of filenames. Biome supports the following globs:

- `*` matches zero or more characters. It cannot match the path separator `/`.
- `**` recursively matches directories and files. This sequence **must** form a single path component, so both `**a` and `b**` are invalid and will result in an error. A sequence of more than two consecutive `*` characters is also invalid.
- `[...]` matches any character inside the brackets. Ranges of characters can also be specified, as ordered by Unicode, so e.g. `[0-9]` specifies any character between 0 and 9 inclusive.
- `[!...]` is the negation of `[...]`, i.e. it matches any characters **not** in the brackets.

Some examples:

- `dist/**` matches the dist directory and all files in this directory.
- `**/test/**` matches all files under any directory named `test`, regardless of where they are. E.g. `dist/test`, `src/test`.
- `**/*.js` matches all files ending with the extension `.js` in all directories.

Biome uses a glob library that treats all globs as having a `**/` prefix. This means that `src/**/*.js` and `**/src/**/*.js` are treated as identical. They match both `src/file.js` and `test/src/file.js`.

Note: These patterns can be used in a Biome configuration file. Glob patterns used on the command line are not interpreted by Biome. They are expanded by your shell. Some shells don't support the recursive glob `**`.

# Integrate Biome in an editor extension

Biome has [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) first-class support. If your editor does implement LSP, then the integration of Biome should be seamless.

## Use the LSP proxy

Biome has a command called `lsp-proxy`. When executed, Biome will spawn two processes:
- a daemon that does execute the requested operations;
- a server that functions as a proxy between the requests of the client - the editor - and the server - the daemon;

If your editor is able to interact with a server and send [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) request, you only need to configure the editor run that command.

You can check how the [neo-vim biome extension](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/lua/lspconfig/server_configurations/biome.lua) does it.

## Use `stdin`

If your editor doesn't support LSP, you use directly the binary `biome` and call it using [standard input](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_input_(stdin)).

The following commands can be called via standard input:
- `format`
- `lint`
- `check`

Biome will return the new output (or the original output if changes haven't occurred) to [standard output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_(stdout)) and the diagnostics to [standard error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_error_(stderr)).

When you use `stdin`, you must pass the `--stdin-file-path` option. The file `path` **doesn't need to exist** in your file system, it can be any name. **What's important** is to provide the correct file extension, so Biome knows **how to treat** your file.

It's the editor's responsibility to locate the resolve the path of the binary and then call it when it's needed. The binaries are shipped to npm based on the architectures and OS that we support:
- `@biomejs/cli-darwin-arm64`
- `@biomejs/cli-darwin-x64`
- `@biomejs/cli-linux-arm64`
- `@biomejs/cli-linux-x64`
- `@biomejs/cli-win32-arm64`
- `@biomejs/cli-win32-x64`

The binary name is `biome` or `biome.exe`, and it can be found in the root directory of the library, e.g.: `@biomejs/cli-darwin-arm64/biome`, `@biomejs/cli-win32-x64/biome.exe`.

## Use the daemon with the binary

Using the binary via CLI is very efficient, although you won't be able to provide logs to your users. The CLI allows you to bootstrap a daemon and then use the CLI commands through the daemon itself.

If order to do so, you first need to start a daemon process with the `start` command:

```shell
biome start
```
Then, every command needs to add the `--use-server` options, e.g.:

```shell
echo "console.log('')" | biome format --use-server --stdin-file-path=dummy.js
```

### Note
If you decide to use the daemon, you're also responsible to restart/kill the process with the `stop` command, to avoid having ghost processes.

### Caution
Operations via the daemon are significantly slower than the CLI itself, so it's advised to run operations only on single files.

## Daemon logs

The Biome daemon saves logs in your file system. Logs are stored in a folder called `biome-logs`. The path of  this folder changes based on your operative system:
-  Linux: `~/.cache/biome`;
-  Windows: `C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\biomejs\biome\cache`
-  macOS: `/Users/<UserName>/Library/Caches/dev.biomejs.biome`

For other operative systems, you can find the folder in the system's temporary directory.

To obtain the precise path, execute the following command:
```shell
biome explain daemon-logs
```

The log files are rotated on an hourly basis.

# Getting Started

## Installation

The fastest way to download Biome is to use a package manager such as `npm`. This requires Node.js v14.18 or newer. The CLI is also available as a [standalone executable](https://biomejs.dev/guides/manual-installation) if you want to use Biome without installing Node.js.

To install Biome, run the following commands in a directory containing a `package.json` file.

### Using npm
```bash
npm install --save-dev --save-exact @biomejs/biome
```

### Using pnpm
```bash
pnpm add --save-dev --save-exact @biomejs/biome
```

### Using yarn
```bash
yarn add --dev --exact @biomejs/biome
```

### Using bun
```bash
bun add --dev --exact @biomejs/biome
```

### Using deno
```bash
deno add --dev npm:@biomejs/biome
```

We instruct the package manager to pin an exact version of Biome. This ensures that everyone within a project has exactly the same version of Biome. Even a patch release can result in slightly different behavior. See the [versioning page](https://biomejs.dev/internals/versioning/) for more information.

## Configuration

We recommend that you create a `biome.json` or a `biome.jsonc` configuration file for each project. This eliminates the need to repeat the CLI options each time you run a command, and ensures that Biome uses the same configuration in your editor. Some options are also only available from a configuration file. If you are happy with Biome's defaults, you don't need to create a configuration file.

To create the `biome.json` file, run the `init` command in the root folder of your project:
```bash
biome init
```

Pass the `--jsonc` option to emit a `biome.jsonc` file instead.

After running the `init` command, you'll have a new `biome.json` file in your directory:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schema.json",
  "extends": ["biome:recommended"],
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true
  },
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true
    }
  }
}
```

The `linter.enabled: true` enables the linter and `rules.recommended: true` enables the [recommended rules](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/). This corresponds to the default settings.

Formatting is enabled **by default**, but you can [disable](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#formatterenabled) it by explicitly using `formatter.enabled: false`.

## Usage

The Biome CLI comes with many commands and options, so you can use only what you need.

You can format files and directories using the `format` command with the `--write` option:
```bash
biome format --write <files>
```

You can lint and apply [safe fixes](https://biomejs.dev/linter#safe-fixes) to files and directories using the `lint` command with the `--write` option:
```bash
biome lint --write <files>
```

You can run **both** of them by leveraging the `check` command:
```bash
biome check --write <files>
```

The `check` command runs multiple tools at once. It formats, lints, and organizes imports.

## Install an editor plugin

We recommend installing an editor plugin to get the most out of Biome. Check out the [editor page](https://biomejs.dev/guides/integrate-in-editor) to know which editors support Biome.

## CI Setup

If you're using Node.js, the recommended way to run Biome in CI is to use [your preferred package manager](https://biomejs.dev/guides/getting-started#installation). This ensures that your CI pipeline uses the same version of Biome as you do inside the editor or when running local CLI commands. Alternatively, you can use a dedicated [CI Action](https://biomejs.dev/recipes/continuous-integration).

```

The log files are rotated on an hourly basis.
You can remove the logs using the `clean` command:

```shell
biome clean
```

# Integrate Biome with your VCS

The VCS (Version Control System) integration is meant to take advantage of additional features that only a VCS can provide. At the moment, Biome only supports Git. The integration is opt-in. You have to enable `vcs.enabled` and set `vcs.clientKind` in the Biome configuration file:

```json
{
  "vcs": {
    "enabled": true,
    "clientKind": "git"
  }
}
```

This configuration doesn't do anything per se. You need to opt-in the features you want.

### Use the ignore file

Enable `vcs.useIgnoreFile`, to allow Biome to ignore all the files and directories listed in your VCS ignore file. For now, Biome only takes the ignore file in the working directory into account.

```json
{
  "vcs": {
    "enabled": true,
    "clientKind": "git",
    "useIgnoreFile": true
  }
}
```

### Process only changed files

This is a feature that is available only via CLI, and allows processing only the files that have changed from one revision to another.

First, you have to update your configuration file and tell Biome what's the default branch via the `vcs.defaultBranch` field:

```json
{
  "vcs": {
    "enabled": true,
    "clientKind": "git",
    "useIgnoreFile": true,
    "defaultBranch": "main"
  }
}
```

Then, add the `--changed` option to your command, to process only those files that your VCS acknowledged as "changed". Biome, with the help of the VCS, will determine the changed file from the branch `main` and your current revision:

```shell
biome check --changed
```

**Note:** Biome doesn't check what's changed, this means that even adding spaces or newlines to a file, will mark this file as "changed".

Alternatively, you can use the option `--since` to specify an arbitrary branch. This option takes precedence over the option `vcs.defaultBranch`. For example, you might want to check your changes against the `next` branch:

```shell
biome check --changed --since=next
```

### Process only staged files

Before committing your changes, you may want to check the formatting and lints files that have been added to the _index_, also known as _staged files_. Add the `--staged` option to your command, to process only those files:

```shell
biome check --staged
```

**Note:** The `--staged` option is not available on the `ci` command because you are not expected to commit changes in a CI environment.

# Manual Installation

## Overview

Using Biome's standalone CLI binary can be a great choice if you aren't already using Node.js or `npm` (or any other package manager). Or in other words, Biome shouldn't be the only reason for you to have a `package.json`.

## Supported Platforms

You have to pick the correct binary for your platform for Biome to work. The following table should help you do so.

| CPU Architecture | Windows       | macOS                        | Linux         | Linux (musl)       |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| `arm64`          | `win32-arm64` | `darwin-arm64` (M1 or newer) | `linux-arm64` | `linux-arm64-musl` |
| `x64`            | `win32-x64`   | `darwin-x64`                 | `linux-x64`   | `linux-x64-musl`   |

## Homebrew

Biome is available as a [Homebrew formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/biome) for macOS and Linux users.

```shell
brew install biome
```

## Using a Published Binary

To install Biome, grab the executable for your platform from the [latest CLI release](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/releases) on GitHub and give it execution permission.

### macOS (arm, M1 or newer)

```shell
curl -L https://github.com/biomejs/biome/releases/download/cli%2Fv<version>/biome-darwin-arm64 -o biome
chmod +x biome
```

### Linux (x86_64)

```shell
curl -L https://github.com/biomejs/biome/releases/download/cli%2Fv<version>/biome-linux-x64 -o biome
chmod +x biome
```

### Windows (x86_64, Powershell)

```shell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/biomejs/biome/releases/download/cli%2Fv<version>/biome-win32-x64.exe" -OutFile "biome.exe"
```

Note: Make sure to replace `<version>` with the Biome version you want to install.

## Next Steps

Now you can use Biome by simply running `./biome`. Follow our [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/blob/main/docs/guides/getting-started.md) for more information.

# Migrate from ESLint and Prettier

Biome provides dedicated commands to ease the migration from ESLint and Prettier.

## Quick Start

If you don't want to know the details, just run the following commands:

```shell
biome migrate eslint --write
biome migrate prettier --write
```

## Migrate from ESLint

Many Biome linter rules are inspired by or identical to the ESLint rules or the rules of an ESLint plugin.
We handle some ESLint plugins such as [TypeScript ESLint](https://typescript-eslint.io/), [ESLint JSX A11y](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y), [ESLint React](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react), and [ESLint Unicorn](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn).
However, Biome has its own naming convention for its rules.
Biome uses `camelCaseRuleName` while ESLint uses `kebab-case-rule-name`.
Moreover, Biome has often chosen to use different names to better convey the intent of its rules.
The source of a rule can be found on the page describing the rule.
You can also find the equivalent Biome rule from an ESLint rule using the [dedicated page](https://typescript-eslint.io/).

To ease the migration, Biome provides the `biome migrate eslint` subcommand.
This subcommand will read your ESLint configuration and attempt to port its settings to Biome.
The subcommand is able to handle both the legacy and the flat configuration files.
It supports the `extends` field of the legacy configuration and loads both shared and plugin configurations.
The subcommand also migrates `.eslintignore`.

Given the following ESLint configuration:

```json
{
  "extends": ["plugin:unicorn/recommended"],
  "plugins": ["unicorn"],
  "ignore_patterns": ["dist/**"],
  "globals": {
    "Global1": "readonly"
  },
  "rules": {
    "eqeqeq": "error"
  },
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": ["tests/**"],
      "rules": {
        "eqeqeq": "off"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

And the following Biome configuration:

```json
{
	"linter": {
		"enabled": true,
		"rules": {
			"recommended": true
		}
	}
}
```

Run the following command to migrate your ESLint configuration to Biome.

```shell
biome migrate eslint --write
```

The subcommand overwrites your initial Biome configuration.
For example, it disables `recommended`.
This results in the following Biome configuration:

```json
{
	"organizeImports": { "enabled": true },
	"linter": {
		"enabled": true,
		"rules": {
			"recommended": false,
			"complexity": {
				"noForEach": "error",
				"noStaticOnlyClass": "error",
				"noUselessSwitchCase": "error",
				"useFlatMap": "error"
			},
			"style": {
				"noNegationElse": "off",
				"useForOf": "error",
				"useNodejsImportProtocol": "error",
				"useNumberNamespace": "error"
			},
			"suspicious": {
				"noDoubleEquals": "error",
				"noThenProperty": "error",
				"useIsArray": "error"
			}
		}
	},
	"javascript": { "globals": ["Global1"] },
	"overrides": [
		{
			"include": ["tests/**"],
			"linter": { "rules": { "suspicious": { "noDoubleEquals": "off" } } }
		}
	]
}
```

The subcommand needs Node.js to load and resolve all the plugins and `extends` configured in the ESLint configuration file.
For now, `biome migrate eslint` doesn't support configuration written in YAML.

By default, Biome doesn't migrate inspired rules.
You can use the CLI flag `--include-inspired` to migrate them.

```shell
biome migrate eslint --write --include-inspired
```

Note that you are unlikely to get exactly the same behavior as ESLint because Biome has chosen not to implement some rule options or to deviate slightly from the original implementation.

Since ESLint takes VCS ignore files into account,
we recommend that you enable Biome's [VCS integration](https://typescript-eslint.io/).

Some plugins or shared configurations may export an object with a cyclic reference.
Biome may fail to load such a configuration.

## Migrate from Prettier

Biome tries to match the Prettier formatter as closely as possible.
However, Biome uses different defaults for its formatter.
For example, it uses tabs for indentation instead of spaces.
You can easily migrate to Biome by running `biome migrate prettier --write`.

Given the following Prettier configuration:

```json
{
	"useTabs": false,
	"singleQuote": true,
	"overrides": [
		{
      		"files": ["*.json"],
      		"options": { "tabWidth": 2 }
    	}
	]
}
```

Run the following command to migrate your Prettier configuration to Biome.

```shell
biome migrate prettier --write
```

This results in the following Biome configuration:

```json
{
	"formatter": {
		"enabled": true,
		"formatWithErrors": false,
		"indentStyle": "space",
		"indentWidth": 2,
		"lineEnding": "lf",
		"lineWidth": 80,
		"attributePosition": "auto"
	},
	"organizeImports": { "enabled": true },
	"linter": { "enabled": true, "rules": { "recommended": true } },
	"javascript": {
		"formatter": {
			"jsxQuoteStyle": "double",
			"quoteProperties": "asNeeded",
			"trailingCommas": "all",
			"semicolons": "asNeeded",
			"arrowParentheses": "always",
			"bracketSpacing": true,
			"bracketSameLine": false,
			"quoteStyle": "single",
			"attributePosition": "auto"
		}
	},
	"overrides": [
		{
			"include": ["*.json"],
			"formatter": {
				"indentWidth": 2
			}
		}
	]
}
```

The subcommand needs Node.js to load JavaScript configurations such as `.prettierrc.js`.
`biome migrate prettier` doesn't support configuration written in JSON5, TOML, or YAML.

Since Prettier takes VCS ignore files into account,
we recommend that you enable Biome's [VCS integration](https://typescript-eslint.io/).

# Architecture
This document covers some of the internals of Biome, and how they are used inside the project.

## Parser and CST

The architecture of the parser is bumped by an internal fork of [rowan], a library that implements the [Green and Red tree] pattern.

The CST (Concrete Syntax Tree) is a data structure very similar to an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) that keeps track of all the information of a program, trivia included.

**Trivia** is represented by all that information that is important to a program to run:
- spaces
- tabs
- comments

Trivia is attached to a node. A node can have leading trivia and trailing trivia. If you read code from left to right, leading trivia appears before a keyword, and trailing trivia appears after a keyword.

Leading trivia and trailing trivia are categorized as follows:
- Every trivia up to the token/keyword (including line breaks) will be the **leading trivia**;
- Everything until the next linebreak (but not including it) will be the **trailing trivia**;

Given the following JavaScript snippet, `// comment 1` is a trailing trivia of the token `;`, and `// comment 2` is a leading trivia to the keyword `const`. Below is a minimized version of the CST represented by Biome:

```js
const a = "foo"; // comment 1
// comment 2
const b = "bar";
```

```
0: JS_MODULE@0..55
    ...
      1: SEMICOLON@15..27 ";" [] [Whitespace(" "), Comments("// comment 1")]
    1: JS_VARIABLE_STATEMENT@27..55
        ...
        1: CONST_KW@27..45 "const" [Newline("\n"), Comments("// comment 2"), Newline("\n")] [Whitespace(" ")]
  3: EOF@55..55 "" [] []
```

The CST is never directly accessible by design; a developer can read its information using the Red tree, using a number of APIs that are autogenerated from the grammar of the language.

### Resilient and recoverable parser

In order to construct a CST, a parser needs to be error-resilient and recoverable:
- resilient: a parser that is able to resume parsing after encountering syntax errors that belong to the language;
- recoverable: a parser that is able to **understand** where an error occurred and being able to resume the parsing by creating **correct** information;

The recoverable part of the parser is not a science, and no rules are set in stone. This means that depending on what the parser was parsing and where an error occurred, the parser might be able to recover itself in an expected way.

The parser also uses 'Bogus' nodes to protect the consumers from consuming incorrect syntax. These nodes are used to decorate the broken code caused by a syntax error.

In the following example, the parentheses in the `while` are missing, although the parser can recover itself in a good manner and can represent the code with a decent CST. The parenthesis and condition of the loop are marked as missing, and the code block is correctly parsed:

```js
while {}
```

```
JsModule {
  interpreter_token: missing (optional),
  directives: JsDirectiveList [],
  items: JsModuleItemList [
    JsWhileStatement {
      while_token: WHILE_KW@0..6 "while" [] [Whitespace(" ")],
      l_paren_token: missing (required),
      test: missing (required),
      r_paren_token: missing (required),
      body: JsBlockStatement {
        l_curly_token: L_CURLY@6..7 "{" [] [],
        statements: JsStatementList [],
        r_curly_token: R_CURLY@7..8 "}" [] [],
      },
    },
  ],
  eof_token: EOF@8..8 "" [] [],
}
```

This is an error emitted during parsing:

```
main.tsx:1:7 parse ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

  expected `(` but instead found `{`

  > 1 ‚îÇ while {}
      ‚îÇ       ^

  Remove {
```

The same can't be said for the following snippet. The parser can't properly understand the syntax during the recovery phase, so it needs to rely on the bogus nodes to mark some syntax as erroneous. Notice the `JsBogusStatement`:

```js
function}
```

```
JsModule {
  interpreter_token: missing (optional),
  directives: JsDirectiveList [],
  items: JsModuleItemList [
    TsDeclareFunctionDeclaration {
      async_token: missing (optional),
      function_token: FUNCTION_KW@0..8 "function" [] [],
      id: missing (required),
      type_parameters: missing (optional),
      parameters: missing (required),
      return_type_annotation: missing (optional),
      semicolon_token: missing (optional),
    },
    JsBogusStatement {
      items: [
        R_CURLY@8..9 "}" [] [],
      ],
    },
  ],
  eof_token: EOF@9..9 "" [] [],
}
```

This is the error we get from the parsing phase:

```
main.tsx:1:9 parse ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

  expected a name for the function in a function declaration, but found none

  > 1 ‚îÇ function}
      ‚îÇ         ^
```

## Formatter (WIP)

## Linter (WIP)

## Daemon (WIP)

Biome uses a server-client architecture to run its tasks.

A [daemon] is a long-running server that Biome spawns in the background and uses to process requests from the editor and CLI.

### JavaScript Support

Biome supports the ES2024 version of the language.

Biome supports only the official syntax. The team starts development of the new syntax when a proposal reaches [Stage 3](https://github.com/tc39/proposals#stage-3).

### TypeScript Support

Biome supports TypeScript version 5.6.

### JSONC Support

JSONC stands for "JSON with Comments." This format is widely used by various tools like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-with-comments), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/config-files), etc. because it lets users add comments to configuration files. However, since JSONC isn't a strictly defined standard, there's some variation in how different tools handle trailing commas in JSONC files. To accommodate this, Biome doesn't provide a dedicated language configuration for JSONC. Instead, we've enhanced our JSON parsing and formatting capabilities with options like `json.parser.allowComments`, `json.parser.allowTrailingCommas`, and `json.formatter.trailingCommas`. This approach allows Biome to effectively support different variants of JSON files.

For files with an extension name of `.jsonc` or those identified as `jsonc` according to the [language identifier](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/identifiers), Biome automatically applies the following default settings for parsing and formatting them:

- `json.parser.allowComments`: `true`
- `json.parser.allowTrailingCommas`: `true`
- `json.formatter.trailingCommas`: `none`

Please note, some well-known files like `tsconfig.json` and `.babelrc` don't use the `.jsonc` extension but still allow comments and trailing commas. While others, such as `.eslintrc.json`, only allow comments. Biome is able to identify these files and adjusts the `json.parser.allowTrailingCommas` option accordingly to ensure they are correctly parsed.

### HTML Super Languages Support

As of version `1.6.0`, these languages are **partially** supported. Biome will get better over time, and it will provide more options to tweak your project. As for today, there are some expectations and limitations to take in consideration:

- For `.astro` files, **only** the **frontmatter** portion of the file is supported.
- For `.vue` and `.svelte` files, **only** the **\<script\>** tags portion of the file is supported.
- Diagnostics will only show code frames that belong to the portions mentioned above.
- When **formatting** `.vue` and `.svelte` files, the indentation of the JavaScript/TypeScript code will start from the beginning.

```vue title="file.vue" del={2} ins={3}
<script>
  import Component from "./Component.vue";
  import Component from "./Component.vue";
</script>
```

- When **linting** `.svelte`, `.astro` or `.vue` files, it's advised to turn off few additional rules to prevent compiler errors. Use the option `overrides` for that:

```json
{
  "overrides": [
    {
      "include": ["*.svelte", "*.astro", "*.vue"],
      "linter": {
        "rules": {
          "style": {
            "useConst": "off",
            "useImportType": "off"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Make project intent and decisions known well in advance. Nothing should be a surprise.

### Clear Messaging of Decisions
The team might evaluate options and make decisions using private channels. Team will try to keep discussions using public channels like [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/discussions) or [Discord](https://biomejs.dev/chat). Frequent private check-ins might happen. When decisions occur via private channels, the team has to commit to communicate these decisions using the public channels.

## Technical

### Error Handling
- **Suggest Fixes and Hints**: Errors should suggest fixes and hints where possible. These should be inferred and filtered from usage to reduce surfacing irrelevant and unhelpful messages.
- **Unique and Specific Error Messages**: No generic error messages. This helps users understand what went wrong and should provide maintainers with a unique call site and the necessary information to debug.

### Code Quality
- **Optimise API**: Question the existence of all options and flags. Are they necessary? Can they be combined? How can we reduce code branching?
- **Document Code**: Strive to document the code as much as possible, especially the "hard-to-read" code, or for special logic that requires explanation. A well documented code helps its maintainability, especially when multiple people work on it. The developer after you will benefit from your knowledge, share it.

### Terminology and Naming
- **Reduce Jargon**: Don't assume that users will understand specific terminology. Strive to provide precise meaning for experts and beginners. For example, use "character" where you would traditionally use "token" when producing parser errors.
- **Use Inclusive Terminology**: Use gender-neutral pronouns. No ableist slurs. No usage of terms that could be considered insensitive.
- **Verbose Naming**: Utilize verbosity when naming commands and flags. No unnecessary and confusing abbreviations.

### Output and Compatibility
- **Build for Generic Clients**: Don't assume that a terminal will only consume output using ANSI codes. Use abstractions that could be generalized for viewing in an IDE, browser, or other environments.
- **Unambiguous Terminal Output**: When designing terminal output, don't rely purely on formatting cues like color. Always use a combination of formatting, symbols, and spacing. If all ANSI codes are stripped, all the output should still be understood.

# Versioning

Fixes to lint rules, formatting layouts, etc. might prevent your scripts from passing. Due to the nature of these changes, it's **highly recommended** to save the _exact_ version in your `package.json`, instead of using range operators.

This methodology will make sure that your script won't fail unexpectedly.

## Semantic Versioning

Biome follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Due to the nature of Biome as a toolchain, it can be unclear what changes are considered major, minor, or patch. That's why Biome uses the following versioning guide:

### Patch Release

* Fixing a lint rule that raises lint errors for valid code (false positives)
* Fixing incorrect code suggestions
* Fixing the formatting of a syntax that results in invalid code or changes the semantics of the program
* Improvements to the documentation
* Internal changes that don't change Biome's functionality:
  * Refactors
  * Performance improvements
  * Increase or change in test coverage
* Improving the wording of diagnostics or fixing the rendering of diagnostics
* Re-releases after a failed release
* Changing the formatting of established syntax

### Minor Release

* Adding a new rule or promoting an existing lint rule to a stable group that is not recommended by default
* Adding linting and formatting support for a recently introduced language feature, even if that results in more reported linting errors
* Removal of recommended rules
* Deprecation of existing rules
* Adding new configuration optional configuration options that do not change the formatting or report more lint errors
* Adding a new recommended lint rule or promoting an existing lint rule from the nursery group to a recommended lint rule in a stable group
* Removal of a non-*nursery* rule or demoting a rule to the *nursery* group

### Major Release

* Changes to the configuration that result in different formatting or more reported lint errors (adding/removing options, changing the default value)
* Changes to Biome's public API
* Promotion of new features or tools that require some spotlight

## Visual Studio Code Extension

Visual Studio Code [doesn't support pre-release tags](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#prerelease-extensions) for extensions. That's why Biome uses the following version schema to distinguish stable and previews:

* Stable releases use even version numbers: 10, 12, 14, 16, ...
* Previews use odd version numbers: 11, 13, 15, 17, ...

# Linter

Biome's linter statically analyzes your code to find and fix common errors and to help you write better, modern code.
It supports multiple languages and provides a total of [**rules**](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/blob/main/docs/linter/rules.md).

## Rules

The linter is organized into rules.
A rule emits a diagnostic when it encounters a code that doesn't meet its requirements.
For example, the [noDebugger](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/blob/main/docs/linter/rules/no-debugger.md) rule reports the use of the `debugger` instruction in JavaScript code.

A rule emits diagnostics with a `info`, `warn` or `error` severity.
Diagnostics with an `error` severity cause the command to exit with a non-zero code,
While diagnostics with a `info` or a `warn` severity don't cause the command to fail.

You can cause a command that emits `warn` diagnostics to fail by using the `--error-on-warnings` option:

```shell
biome lint --error-on-warnings ./src
```

By default, the Biome linter only runs the [**recommended rules**](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/blob/main/docs/linter/rules.md#recommended-rules).
To disable _all rules_, you can disable the recommended rules in your Biome configuration file.
This may be useful in cases when you only want to enable a few rules.
The recommended rules emit diagnostics with the `error` severity.

The rules are divided into groups.
For example, the `noDebugger` rule is part of the [`suspicious` group](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/blob/main/docs/linter/rules.md#suspicious).
Rules from this group detect code that is likely to be incorrect or useless.
The description of each group can be found on the [rules page](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/blob/main/docs/linter/rules.md).

Unlike other linters, we don't provide any rules that check for code formatting.
This kind of checking is covered by our [code formatter](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/blob/main/docs/formatter.md).

Many rules provide a **code fix** that can be automatically applied.
Biome distinguishes between **safe** and **unsafe** code fixes.

### Safe fixes

Safe fixes are guaranteed to not change the semantic of your code.
They can be applied without explicit review.

To apply _safe fixes_, use `--write`:

```shell
biome lint --write ./src
```

### Unsafe fixes

Unsafe fixes may change the semantic of your program.
Therefore, it's advised to manually review the changes.

To apply both _safe fixes_ and _unsafe fixes_, use `--write --unsafe`:

```shell
biome lint --write --unsafe ./src
```

### Rule pillars

We believe that rules should be informative and explain to the user why a rule is triggered and tell the user what they should to do fix the error.
A rule should follow these **pillars**:

1. Explain to the user the error. Generally, this is the message of the diagnostic.
2. Explain to the user **why** the error is triggered. Generally, this is implemented with an additional node.
3. Tell the user what they should do. Generally, this is implemented using a code action.
If a code action is not applicable a note should tell the user what they should do to fix the error.

If you think a rule doesn't follow these pillars,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/new?assignees=&labels=S-To+triage&projects=&template=01_bug.yml&title=%F0%9F%90%9B+%3CTITLE%3E).

## CLI

The following command runs the linter on all files in the `src` directory:

```shell
biome lint ./src
```

The command accepts a list of files and directories.

:::caution
If you pass a glob as a parameter, your shell will expand it.
The result of the expansion depends on your shell.
For example, some shells don't support the recursive glob `**` or the alternation `{}` in the following command:

```shell
biome lint ./src/**/*.test.{js,ts}
```

Shell expansion has a performance cost and a limit on the number of files you can pass to the command.
:::

For more information about all the available options, check the [CLI reference](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/blob/main/docs/reference/cli.md#biome-lint).

### Skip a rule or a group

Since version **v1.8.0**, the command `biome lint` accepts an option `--skip` that allows to disable a rule or rules that belong to a group.

For example, the following command skips all the rules that belong to the `style` group and the `suspicious/noExplicitAny` rule:

```shell
biome lint --skip=style --skip=suspicious/noExplicitAny
```

### Run a rule or a group

Since version **v1.8.0**, the command `biome lint` accepts an option `--only` that allows you to run a single rule or the rules that belong to a group.

For example, the following command runs only the rule`style/useNamingConvention`, the rule `style/noInferrableTypes` and the rules that belong to `a11y`. If the rule is disabled in the configuration, then its severity level is set to `error` for a recommended rule or `warn` otherwise.

```shell
biome lint --only=style/useNamingConvention --only=style/noInferrableTypes --only=a11y
```

## Configuration

A rule can be configured based on your needs.

### Disable a rule

A rule is enabled whether its severity is `error`, `warn` or `info`. You can turn off a rule with `off`.

The following configuration disables the recommended `noDebugger` rule and enables the `noShoutyConstants` and `useNamingConvention` rules.

The `warn` severity is useful in cases where there's a refactor going on and there's a need to make the CI pass. The diagnostic message is yellow. You can use `--error-on-warnings` to exit with an error code when a rule configured with `warn` is triggered.

The `info` severity won't affect the exit status code of the CLI, even when `--error-on-warnings` is passed. The diagnostic message color is blue.

```json
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "suspicious": {
        "noDebugger": "off",
        "noConsoleLog": "info"
      },
      "style": {
        "noShoutyConstants": "warn",
        "useNamingConvention": "error"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configure the rule fix

Since version **v1.8.0**, it's possible to configure the entity of a fix, using the option `fix`.
There are three options:

- `none`: the rule won't emit a code fix;
- `safe`: the rule will emit a [safe fix](#safe-fixes);
- `unsafe`: the rule will emit an [unsafe fix](#unsafe-fixes);

```json
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "correctness": {
        "noUnusedVariables": {
          "level": "error",
          "fix": "none"
        }
      },
      "style": {
        "useConst": {
          "level": "warn",
          "fix": "unsafe"
        },
        "useTemplate": {
          "level": "warn",
          "fix": "safe"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Rule options

A few rules have options.
You can set them by shaping the value of the rule differently.

- `level` will indicate the severity of the diagnostic;
- `options` will change based on the rule.

```json
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "style": {
        "useNamingConvention": {
          "level": "error",
          "options": {
            "strictCase": false
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Ignore code

There are times when a developer wants to ignore a lint rule for a specific line of the code.
You can achieve this by adding a suppression comment above the line that emits the lint diagnostic.

Suppression comments have the following format:

```js
// biome-ignore lint: <explanation>
// biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noDebugger: <explanation>
```

Where

- `biome-ignore` is the start of a suppression comment;
- `lint` suppresses the linter;
- `/suspicious/noDebugger`: **optional**, group and name of the rule you want to suppress;
- `<explanation>` explanation why the rule is disabled

Here's an example:

```ts
// biome-ignore lint: reason
debugger;
// biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason
debugger;
```

Biome doesn't provide ignore comments that ignore an entire file.
However, you can [ignore a file using the Biome configuration file](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/blob/main/docs/guides/configure-biome.md#ignore-files).
Note that you can also [ignore the files ignored by your VCS](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/blob/main/docs/guides/integrate-in-vcs.md#use-the-ignore-file).

## Migrate from other linters

Many of Biome lint rules are inspired from other linters.
If you want to migrate from other linters such as ESLint or `typescript-eslint`,
check the [rules sources page](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/blob/main/docs/linter/rules-sources.md)
If you are migrating from ESLint,
we have a dedicated [migration guide](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/blob/main/docs/guides/migrate-eslint-prettier.md#migrate-from-eslint).

## Nursery

New rules that are still under development.  
Nursery rules require explicit opt-in via configuration on stable versions because they may still have bugs or performance problems.  
They are enabled by default on nightly builds, but as they are unstable their diagnostic severity may be set to either error or warning, depending on whether we intend for the rule to be recommended or not when it eventually gets stabilized.  
Nursery rules get promoted to other groups once they become stable or may be removed.  
Rules that belong to this group **are not subject to semantic version**.

## Recommended rules

The recommended rules are:

<RecommendedRules />

# noAccessKey

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/a11y/noAccessKey`

### Since: `v1.0.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.
This rule has an **unsafe** fix.

Sources: 
- Same as: jsx-a11y/no-access-key

Enforce that the `accessKey` attribute is not used on any HTML element.

The `accessKey` assigns a keyboard shortcut to the current element. However, the `accessKey` value
can conflict with keyboard commands used by screen readers and keyboard-only users, which leads to
inconsistent keyboard actions across applications. To avoid accessibility complications,
this rule suggests users remove the `accessKey` attribute on elements.

### Examples

#### Invalid

```jsx
<input type="submit" accessKey="s" value="Submit" />
```

```jsx
<a href="https://webaim.org/" accessKey="w">WebAIM.org</a>
```

```jsx
<button accessKey="n">Next</button>
```

# noAccumulatingSpread

**Diagnostic Category: `lint/performance/noAccumulatingSpread`**

**Since**: `v1.0.0`

Disallow the use of spread (`...`) syntax on accumulators.

Spread syntax allows an iterable to be expanded into its individual elements.

Spread syntax should be avoided on accumulators (like those in `.reduce`) because it causes a time complexity of `O(n^2)` instead of `O(n)`.

Source: prateeksurana.me/blog/why-using-object-spread-with-reduce-bad-idea/

## Examples

### Invalid

```js
var a = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
a.reduce((acc, val) => [...acc, val], []);
```

```js
var a = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
a.reduce((acc, val) => {return [...acc, val];}, []);
```

```js
var a = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
a.reduce((acc, val) => ({...acc, [val]: val}), {});
```

### Valid

```js
var a = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
a.reduce((acc, val) => {acc.push(val); return acc}, []);

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.
This rule has an **unsafe** fix.

Sources: 
- Same as: `approx_constant`

Use standard constants instead of approximated literals.

Usually, the definition in the standard library is more precise than
what people come up with or the used constant exceeds the maximum precision of the number type.

## Examples

### Invalid

```javascript
let x = 3.141;

# noAriaHiddenOnFocusable

**Diagnostic Category: `lint/a11y/noAriaHiddenOnFocusable`**

**Since**: `v1.4.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.
This rule has an **unsafe** fix.

Sources: 
- Same as: jsx-a11y/no-aria-hidden-on-focusable

Enforce that aria-hidden="true" is not set on focusable elements.

`aria-hidden="true"` can be used to hide purely decorative content from screen reader users.
A focusable element with `aria-hidden="true"` can be reached by keyboard.
This can lead to confusion or unexpected behavior for screen reader users.

## Example

### Invalid

```jsx
<div aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="0" />
```

```jsx
<a href="/" aria-hidden="true" />
```

### Valid

```jsx

### Since: `v1.0.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.

### Sources

- Same as: react/no-array-index-key

Discourage the usage of Array index in keys.

We don‚Äôt recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change.
This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.
Check out Robin Pokorny‚Äôs article for an in-depth explanation on the negative impacts of using an index as a key: https://robinpokorny.com/blog/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern/
If you choose not to assign an explicit key to list items then React will default to using indexes as keys.

# noAssignInExpressions

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/suspicious/noAssignInExpressions`

### Since: `v1.0.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.

Sources: 
- Inspired from: no-cond-assign

Disallow assignments in expressions.

In expressions, it is common to mistype a comparison operator (such as `==`) as an assignment operator (such as `=`).
Moreover, the use of assignments in expressions is confusing.
Indeed, expressions are often considered as side-effect free.

## Examples

### Invalid

```ts
let a, b;
a = (b = 1) + 1;
```

```text
code-block.ts:2:6 lint/suspicious/noAssignInExpressions 
 The assignment should not be in an expression.
  1 ‚îÇ let a, b;
> 2 ‚îÇ a = (b = 1) + 1;
  ‚îÇ     ^^^^
 3 ‚îÇ

# noAsyncPromiseExecutor

Disallows using an async function as a Promise executor.

**Diagnostic Category: `lint/suspicious/noAsyncPromiseExecutor`**

**Since**: `v1.0.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.

Sources: 
- Same as: `no-async-promise-executor`

The executor function can also be an async function. However, this is usually a mistake, for a few reasons:

1. If an async executor function throws an error, the error will be lost and won't cause the newly-constructed `Promise` to reject. This could make it difficult to debug and handle some errors.
2. If a Promise executor function is using `await`, this is usually a sign that it is not actually necessary to use the `new Promise` constructor, or the scope of the `new Promise` constructor can be reduced.

## Examples

### Invalid

```javascript
new Promise(async function foo(resolve, reject) {})
```

```javascript
new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {})
```

```javascript
new Promise(((((async () => {})))))
```

### Valid

```javascript
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {})
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {}, async function unrelated() {})
new Foo(async (resolve, reject) => {})
new Foo((( (resolve, reject) => {} )))
```

# noAutofocus

**Diagnostic Category: `lint/a11y/noAutofocus`**

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.
This rule has an **unsafe** fix.

Sources: 
- Same as: jsx-a11y/no-autofocus

Enforce that autoFocus prop is not used on elements.

Autofocusing elements can cause usability issues for sighted and non-sighted users, alike.

## Examples

### Invalid

```jsx
<input autoFocus />
```

```jsx
<input autoFocus="true" />
```

```jsx
<input autoFocus={"false"} />
```

```jsx
<input autoFocus={undefined} />
```

### Valid

```jsx
<input />
```

```jsx
<div />
```

```jsx
<button />
```

```jsx
// `autoFocus` prop in user created component is valid
<MyComponent autoFocus={true} />
```

# noBannedTypes

Disallow primitive type aliases and misleading types.

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/complexity/noBannedTypes`

### Since: `v1.0.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.
This rule has a **safe** fix.

Sources: 
- Same as: `@typescript-eslint/ban-types`

Disallow primitive type aliases and misleading types.

### Enforce consistent names for primitive types

Primitive types have aliases.
For example, `Number` is an alias of `number`.
The rule recommends the lowercase primitive type names.

### Disallow the `Function` type

The `Function` type is loosely typed and is thus considered dangerous or harmful.
`Function` is equivalent to the type `(...rest: any[]) => any` that uses the unsafe `any` type.

### Disallow the misleading non-nullable type `{}`

In TypeScript, the type `{}` doesn't represent an empty object.
It represents any value except `null` and `undefined`.
The following TypeScript example is perfectly valid:

```ts
const n: {} = 0
```

To represent an empty object, you should use `{ [k: string]: never }` or `Record<string, never>`.

To avoid any confusion, the rule forbids the use of the type `{}`, except in two situations:

1. In type constraints to restrict a generic type to non-nullable types:

```ts
function f<T extends {}>(x: T) {
    assert(x != null);
}
```

2. In a type intersection to narrow a type to its non-nullable equivalent type:

```ts
type NonNullableMyType = MyType & {};
```

In this last case, you can also use the `NonNullable` utility type:

```ts
type NonNullableMyType = NonNullable<MyType>;
```

## Examples

### Invalid

```ts
let foo: String = "bar";

# noBarrelFile

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/performance/noBarrelFile`

**Since**: `v1.6.0`

Sources: 
- Inspired from: barrel-files/avoid-barrel-files

Disallow the use of barrel file.

A barrel file is a file that re-exports all of the exports from other files in a directory.
This structure results in the unnecessary loading of many modules, significantly impacting performance in large-scale applications.
Additionally, it complicates the codebase, making it difficult to navigate and understand the project's dependency graph.
This rule ignores .d.ts files and type-only exports.

For a more detailed explanation, check out https://marvinh.dev/blog/speeding-up-javascript-ecosystem-part-7/

## Examples

### Invalid

```js
export * from "foo";
export * from "bar";
```

```js
export { foo } from "foo";
export { bar } from "bar";
```

```js
export { default as module1 } from "./module1";
```

### Valid

```ts
export type * from "foo";
export type { foo } from "foo";
```

# noBlankTarget

Disallow `target="_blank"` attribute without `rel="noreferrer"`

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/a11y/noBlankTarget`

### Since: `v1.0.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.
This rule has a **safe** fix.

Sources: 
- Same as: react/jsx-no-target-blank

When creating anchor `a` element, there are times when its link has to be opened in a new browser tab
via `target="_blank"` attribute. This attribute has to paired with `rel="noreferrer"` or you're incur
in a security issue.

Refer to the noreferrer documentation and the noopener documentation

## Examples

### Invalid

```jsx
<a href='http://external.link' target='_blank'>child</a>
```

```jsx
<a href='http://external.link' target='_blank' rel="noopener">child</a>
```

```jsx
<a {...props} href='http://external.link' target='_blank' rel="noopener">child</a>
```

### Valid

```jsx
<a href='http://external.link' rel='noreferrer' target='_blank'>child</a>
```

```jsx
<a href='http://external.link' target='_blank' rel="noopener" {...props}>child</a>
```

## Options

The option `allowDomains` allows specific domains to use `target="_blank"` without `rel="noreferrer"`.
In the following configuration, it's allowed to use the domains `https://example.com` and `example.org`:

```json
{
    "//": "...",
    "options": {
        "allowDomains": ["https://example.com", "example.org"]
    }
}
```

```jsx
<>
  <a target="_blank" href="https://example.com"></a>
  <a target="_blank" href="example.org"></a>

## Diagnostic Category
lint/suspicious/noClassAssign

## Since
v1.0.0

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.

## Sources
- Same as: no-class-assign

## Description
A class declaration creates a variable that we can modify, however, the modification is a mistake in most cases.

## Examples

### Invalid

```javascript
class A {}
A = 0;
```

```javascript
A = 0;
class A {}
```

```javascript
class A {
	b() {
		A = 0;

# noCommaOperator

Disallow comma operator.

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/style/noCommaOperator`

### Since: `v1.0.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.

Sources: 
- Same as: no-sequences

The comma operator includes multiple expressions where only one is expected.
It evaluates every operand from left to right and returns the value of the last operand.
It frequently obscures side effects, and its use is often an accident.

The use of the comma operator in the initialization and update parts of a `for` is still allowed.

## Examples

### Invalid

```js
const foo = (doSomething(), 0);
```

```js
for (; doSomething(), !!test; ) {}
```

```js
// Use a semicolon instead.
let a, b;
a = 1, b = 2;
```

### Valid

```js
for(a = 0, b = 0; (a + b) < 10; a++, b += 2) {}
```

# noCommonJs
Disallow use of CommonJs module system in favor of ESM style imports.

**Diagnostic Category: `lint/nursery/noCommonJs`**

**Since**: `v1.9.0`

This rule is part of the nursery group.

Sources: 
- Same as: @typescript-eslint/no-require-imports
- Same as: import/no-commonjs

Disallow use of CommonJs module system in favor of ESM style imports.

ESM-style `import`s are modern alternative to CommonJS `require` imports. Supported by all modern browsers and Node.js versions.
Tooling can more easily statically analyze and tree-shake ESM `import`s compared to CommonJs.

## Examples

### Invalid

```js
require('node:fs');
```

```js
module.exports = { a: 'b' }
```

```js
exports.a = 'b';
```

### Valid

```js
import fs from 'node:fs';
```

```js
import('node:fs')
```

```js
export const a = 'b';
```

```js
export default { a: 'b' };
```

## Caveats

Rule is automatically disabled inside `.cjs` and `.cts` files, because they are explicitly CommonJs files.

This rule could be helpful if you are migrating from CommonJs to ESM,
but if you wish to continue using CommonJs, you can safely disable it.

## Diagnostic Category
lint/suspicious/noConfusingLabels

## Since
v1.0.0

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.

## Sources

Labeled statements in JavaScript are used in conjunction with `break` and `continue` to control flow around multiple loops. Their use for other statements is suspicious and unfamiliar.

The rule ignores reactive Svelte statements in Svelte components.

## Examples

### Invalid

```js
label: f();
```

```js
label: {
    f();
    break label;
}
```

```js

# noConfusingVoidType

Disallow `void` type outside of generic or return types.

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/suspicious/noConfusingVoidType`

### Since: `v1.2.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.
This rule has an **unsafe** fix.

Sources: 
- Same as: `@typescript-eslint/no-invalid-void-type`

`void` in TypeScript refers to a function return that is meant to be ignored.
Attempting to use a void type outside of a return type or a type parameter is often a sign of programmer error.
`void` can also be misleading for other developers even if used correctly.

The `void` type means cannot be mixed with any other types, other than `never`, which accepts all types.
If you think you need this then you probably want the `undefined` type instead.

The code action suggests using `undefined` instead of `void`.
It is unsafe because a variable with the `void` type cannot be assigned to a variable with the `undefined` type.

## Examples

### Invalid

```ts
let foo: void;
```

```ts
function logSomething(thing: void) {}
```

```ts
interface Interface {
    prop: void;
}
```

```ts
type PossibleValues = number | void;
```

### Valid

```ts
function foo(): void {};
```

```ts
function doSomething(this: void) {}
```

```ts
function printArg<T = void>(arg: T) {}

# noConstEnum

They're not commonly used in JavaScript text. So, if you see them in a pattern (called a regular expression), it's probably a mistake.

The following elements of regular expression patterns are considered possible errors in typing and are therefore disallowed by this rule:

- Hexadecimal character escapes from `\x00` to `\x1F`
- Unicode character escapes from `\u0000` to `\u001F`
- Unicode code point escapes from `\u{0}` to `\u{1F}`
- Unescaped raw characters from U+0000 to U+001F

Control escapes such as `\t` and `\n` are allowed by this rule.

# noDefaultExport

Disallow default exports.

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/style/noDefaultExport`

### Since: `v1.4.0`

Sources: 
- Same as: import/no-default-export

Disallow default exports.

Default exports cannot be easily discovered inside an editor:
They cannot be suggested by the editor when the user tries to import a name.

Also, default exports don't encourage consistency over a code base:
the module that imports the default export must choose a name.
It is likely that different modules use different names.

Moreover, default exports encourage exporting an object that acts as a namespace.
This is a legacy pattern used to mimic CommonJS modules.

For all these reasons, a team may want to disallow default exports.

Note that this rule disallows only default exports in EcmaScript Module.
It ignores CommonJS default exports.

## Examples

### Invalid

```js
export default function f() {};
```

```js
export default class C {};
```

```js
export default {
    f() {},
    g() {},
};
```

```js
export { X as default };
```

### Valid

```js
export function f () {};
export class C {};
export { default as X } from "mod";
```

```cjs

# noDelete

Disallow the use of the `delete` operator.

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/performance/noDelete`

### Since: `v1.0.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.
This rule has an **unsafe** fix.

The `delete` operator enables the removal of a property from an object.

The `delete` operator should be avoided because it [can prevent some optimizations of _JavaScript_ engines](https://webkit.org/blog/10298/inline-caching-delete/).
Moreover, it can lead to unexpected results.
For instance, deleting an array element [does not change the length of the array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete#deleting_array_elements).

The only legitimate use of `delete` is on an object that behaves like a _map_.
To allow this pattern, this rule does not report `delete` on computed properties that are not literal values.
Consider using [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) instead of an object.

## Examples

### Invalid

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
delete arr[0];
```

```js
const obj = {a: {b: {c: 123}}};
delete obj.a.b.c;
```

### Valid

```js
const foo = new Set([1,2,3]);
foo.delete(1);
```

```js
const map = Object.create(null);
const key = "key"
map[key] = "value"
delete map[key];
```

```js
let x = 5;
delete f(); // uncovered by this rule.
```

# noDoubleEquals

Require the use of `===` and `!==`.

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals`

### Since: `v1.0.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.
This rule has an **unsafe** fix.

Sources: 
- Same as: eqeqeq

Require the use of `===` and `!==`.

It is generally bad practice to use `==` for comparison instead of
`===`. Double operators will trigger implicit type coercion
and are thus not preferred. Using strict equality operators is almost
always best practice.

For ergonomic reasons, this rule makes by default an exception for `== null` for
comparing to both `null` and `undefined`.

## Examples

### Invalid

```js
foo == bar
```

### Valid

```js
foo == null
```

```js
foo != null
```

```js
null == foo
```

```js
null != foo
```

## Options

The rule provides the option described below.

```json
{
    "//":"...",
    "options": {
        "ignoreNull": true
    }
}
```

### ignoreNull

When this option is set to `true`, an exception will be made for checking against `null`,
as relying on the double equals operator to compare with `null` is frequently used to check
equality with either `null` or `undefined`.

When the option is set to `false`, all double equal operators will be forbidden without
exceptions.

Default: `true`

# noDuplicateElseIf
Disallow duplicate conditions in if-else-if chains

**Diagnostic Category: lint/nursery/noDuplicateElseIf**

**Since:** v1.6.2

This rule is part of the nursery group.

Sources: 
- Same as: no-dupe-else-if

Disallow duplicate conditions in if-else-if chains

if-else-if chains are commonly used when there is a need to execute only one branch (or at most one branch) out of several possible branches, based on certain conditions.

Two identical test conditions in the same chain are almost always a mistake in the code. Unless there are side effects in the expressions, a duplicate will evaluate to the same true or false value as the identical expression earlier in the chain, meaning that its branch can never execute.

Please note that this rule does not compare conditions from the chain with conditions inside statements.

## Examples

### Invalid

```javascript
if (a) {
    foo();
} else if (b) {
    bar();
} else if (b) {
    baz();
}
```

This branch can never execute. Its condition is a duplicate or covered by previous conditions in the if-else-if chain.

### Valid

```javascript
if (a) {
    foo();
} else if (b) {
    bar();
} else if (c) {
    baz();
}

# noDynamicNamespaceImportAccess

Disallow accessing namespace imports dynamically.

Accessing namespace imports dynamically can prevent efficient tree shaking and increase bundle size.
This happens because the bundler cannot determine which parts of the namespace are used at compile time,
so it must include the entire namespace in the bundle.

Instead, consider using named imports or if that is not possible
access the namespaced import properties statically.

If you want to completely disallow namespace imports, consider using the noNamespaceImport rule.

## Examples

### Invalid

```javascript
import * as foo from "foo"
foo["bar"]
```

```javascript
import * as foo from "foo"
const key = "bar"
foo[key]
```

### Valid

```javascript
import * as foo from "foo"
foo.bar
```

```javascript
import { bar } from "foo"
bar
```

```javascript
import messages from "i18n"

  hello: messages.hello,
  goodbye: messages.goodbye
}

### Since: `v1.3.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.

Sources: 
- Same as: no-empty-character-class

Disallow empty character classes in regular expression literals.

Empty character classes don't match anything.
In contrast, negated empty classes match any character.
They are often the result of a typing mistake.

## Examples

### Invalid

```js
/^a[]/.test("a"); // false
```

The regular expression includes this empty character class.
Empty character classes don't match anything.
If you want to match against [, escape it \[.
Otherwise, remove the character class or fill it.

```js

# noEmptyInterface

Disallow the declaration of empty interfaces.

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/suspicious/noEmptyInterface`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.
This rule has a **safe** fix.

Sources: 
- Inspired from: `@typescript-eslint/no-empty-interface`

Disallow the declaration of empty interfaces.

An empty interface in TypeScript does very little: any non-nullable value is assignable to `{}`.
Using an empty interface is often a sign of programmer error, such as misunderstanding the concept of `{}` or forgetting to fill in fields.

The rule ignores empty interfaces that `extends` one or multiple types.

## Examples

# noEmptyTypeParameters

Disallow empty type parameters in type aliases and interfaces.

## Diagnostic Category

## Since
v1.5.0

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.

TypeScript permits the use of empty type parameter lists in type alias and interface declarations; however, this practice is generally discouraged.
Allowing empty type parameter lists can lead to unclear or ambiguous code, where the intention of the generic type is not self-evident.
This rule disallows empty type parameter lists in type alias and interface declarations.

## Examples

# noEnum

Disallow TypeScript enum.

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/nursery/noEnum`

### Since: `v1.9.0`

This rule is part of the nursery group.

TypeScript enums are not a type-level extension to JavaScript like type annotations or definitions. Users may wish to disable non-type-level extensions to use bundlers or compilers that only strip types.

Const enums are not covered by this rule since `noConstEnum` already handles them. Enums within the ambient context, including declaration files, are ignored as well.

## Examples

### Invalid

```ts
enum Foo {
    BAR = 'bar',
    BAZ = 'baz',
}
```

### Valid

```ts
const Foo = {
    BAR: 'bar',

# noEvolvingTypes

Disallow variables from evolving into `any` type through reassignments.

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/suspicious/noEvolvingTypes`

### Since: `v1.6.3`

Disallow variables from evolving into `any` type through reassignments.

In TypeScript, variables without explicit type annotations can evolve their types based on subsequent assignments.

When TypeScript's noImplicitAny is disabled, variables without explicit type annotations have implicitly the type `any`.
Just like the `any` type, evolved `any` types disable many type-checking rules and should be avoided to maintain strong type safety.
This rule prevents such cases by ensuring variables do not evolve into `any` type, encouraging explicit type annotations and controlled type evolutions.

If you enabled TypeScript's noImplicitAny and want to benefit of evolving types, then we recommend to disable this rule.

## Examples

### Invalid

```ts
let a;
```

The type of this variable may evolve implicitly to any type, including the `any` type.
Add an explicit type or initialization to avoid implicit type evolution.

```ts
const b = [];
```

The type of this variable may evolve implicitly to any type, including the `any` type.
Add an explicit type or initialization to avoid implicit type evolution.

```ts
let c = null;
```

The type of this variable may evolve implicitly to any type, including the `any` type.
Add an explicit type or initialization to avoid implicit type evolution.

### Valid

```ts
let a: number;
let b = 1;
var c : string;
var d = "abn";
const e: never[] = [];
const f = [null];
const g = ['1'];
const h = [1];

# noExcessiveCognitiveComplexity

Disallow functions that exceed a given Cognitive Complexity score.

## Diagnostic Category
lint/complexity/noExcessiveCognitiveComplexity

## Since
v1.0.0

## Sources
- Same as: sonarjs/cognitive-complexity

## Description
The more complexity a function contains, the harder it is to understand later on. Reducing complexity helps to make code more maintainable, both by making it easier to understand as well as by reducing chances of accidental side-effects when making changes.

This rule calculates a complexity score for every function and disallows those that exceed a configured complexity threshold (default: 15).

The complexity score is calculated based on the Cognitive Complexity algorithm: https://redirect.sonarsource.com/doc/cognitive-complexity.html

## Examples

### Invalid

```javascript
function tooComplex() {
    for (let x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
        for (let y = 0; y < 10; y++) {
            for (let z = 0; z < 10; z++) {
                if (x % 2 === 0) {
                    if (y % 2 === 0) {
                        console.log(x > y ? `${x} > ${y}` : `${y} > ${x}`);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

# noExplicitAny

Disallow the `any` type usage.

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/suspicious/noExplicitAny`

### Since: `v1.0.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.

Sources: 
- Same as: `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`

The `any` type in TypeScript is a dangerous "escape hatch" from the type system.
Using `any` disables many type checking rules and is generally best used only as a last resort or when prototyping code.

TypeScript's `--noImplicitAny` compiler option prevents an implied `any`,
but doesn't prevent `any` from being explicitly used the way this rule does.

Sometimes you can use the type `unknown` instead of the type `any`.
It also accepts any value, however it requires to check that a property exists before calling it.

## Examples

### Invalid

let variable: any = 1;

# noExportedImports

Disallow exporting an imported variable.

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/nursery/noExportedImports`

### Since: `v1.9.0`

This rule is part of the nursery group.

Disallow exporting an imported variable.

In JavaScript, you can re-export a variable either by using `export from` or by first importing the variable and then exporting it with a regular `export`.

You may prefer to use the first approach, as it clearly communicates the intention to re-export an import, and can make static analysis easier.

## Examples

### Invalid

```js
import { A } from "mod";
export { A };
```

An import should not be exported. Use `export from` instead.

```js
import * as ns from "mod";
export { ns };

An import should not be exported. Use `export from` instead.

```js
import D from "mod";
export { D };
```

An import should not be exported. Use `export from` instead.

### Valid

The `!` non-null assertion operator in TypeScript is used to assert that a value's type does not include `null` or `undefined`. Using the operator any more than once on a single value does nothing.

## Examples

### Invalid

```ts
const bar = foo!!.bar;
```

```ts
function fn(bar?: { n: number }) {
  return bar!?.n;
}
```

```ts
function fn(bar?: { n: number }) {
  return ((bar!))?.();
}
```

### Valid

```ts
const bar = foo!.bar;

obj?.string!.trim();

function fn(key: string | null) {
  const obj = {};
  return obj?.[key!];
}
```

# noFallthroughSwitchClause

Disallow fallthrough of `switch` clauses.

## Diagnostic Category
lint/suspicious/noFallthroughSwitchClause

## Since
v1.0.0

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.

## Sources
- Same as: no-fallthrough

Switch clauses in `switch` statements fall through by default. This can lead to unexpected behavior when forgotten.

The rule doesn't take `process.exit()` in consideration.

## Examples

### Invalid

```js
switch (bar) {
	case 0:
		a();
	case 1:
		b();
}
```

### Error Message
This case is falling through to the next case. Add a `break` or `return` statement to the end of this case to prevent fallthrough.

### Valid

```js
switch (foo) {
	case 1:
    case 2:
		doSomething();
		break;
    case 3: {
        if (cond) {
            break;
        } else {
            break;

Disallow focused tests.

Disabled test are useful when developing and debugging, because it forces the test suite to run only certain tests.

However, in pull/merge request, you usually want to run all the test suite.

## Examples

### Invalid

# noForEach

**Diagnostic Category: `lint/complexity/noForEach`**

**Since**: `v1.0.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.

Sources: 
- Same as: unicorn/no-array-for-each
- Same as: needless_for_each

Prefer `for...of` statement instead of `Array.forEach`.

Here's a summary of why `forEach` may be disallowed, and why `for...of` is preferred for almost any use-case of `forEach`:

- Performance: Using `forEach` can lead to performance issues, especially when working with large arrays.
When more requirements are added on, `forEach` typically gets chained with other methods like `filter` or `map`, causing multiple iterations over the same Array.
Encouraging for loops discourages chaining and encourages single-iteration logic (e.g. using a continue instead of `filter`).


- Readability: While `forEach` is a simple and concise way to iterate over an array, it can make the code less readable, especially when the callback function is complex.
In contrast, using a for loop or a `for...of` loop can make the code more explicit and easier to read.


- Debugging: `forEach` can make debugging more difficult, because it hides the iteration process.



## Caveat

We consider all objects with a method named `forEach` to be iterable.
This way, this rule applies to all objects with a method called `forEach`, not just `Array` instances.

## Exception for Index Usage

When the index is explicitly used in the `forEach` callback, it is acceptable to use `forEach`. This is because:

- The index is directly available as the second argument in `forEach`, making it convenient for scenarios where the index is necessary.
- In sparse arrays, `forEach` will skip undefined entries, which differs from the behavior of `for...of` with `Object.entries` that includes these entries.
This can be important for certain array operations, particularly in TypeScript environments with strict type checking.

## Examples

### Invalid

```javascript
els.forEach((el) => {
  f(el);
})
```

```javascript
els["forEach"](el => {
  f(el);
})
```

### Valid

```javascript
els.forEach((el, i) => {
  f(el, i)
})
```

# noGlobalAssign

Disallow assignments to native objects and read-only global variables.

**Since**: `v1.5.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.

Sources: 
- Same as: `no-global-assign`

JavaScript's environments contain numerous built-in global variables, such as `window` in browsers and `process` in Node.js.
Assigning values to these global variables can be problematic as it can override essential functionality.

## Examples

### Invalid

Object = null;
```

```js
window = {};
```

# noGlobalEval

Disallow the use of global `eval()`.

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/security/noGlobalEval`

### Since: `v1.5.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.

Sources: 
- Same as: `no-eval`

The `eval()` function evaluates the passed string as a _JavaScript_ code.
The executed code can access and mutate variables in the scope where the function is called.

The use of `eval()` exposes to [security risks and performance issues](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#never_use_eval!).
If the executed code is somehow affected by a malicious party,
then you may end up executing malicious code with the privileges of the caller.
Moreover, changing variables in the caller's scope is expensive in modern _JavaScript_ interpreters.

## Examples

### Invalid

```js
eval("var a = 0");
```

```js
(0, globalThis.eval)("var a = 0")
```

```js
f(eval);
```

```js
const aliasedEval = eval;
```

### Valid

```cjs
function f(eval) {
    eval("let a = 0;");
}
```

The rule is not able to detect cases where the global object is aliased:

```js
let foo = globalThis;
foo.eval("let a = 0;");

# noGlobalIsFinite

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/suspicious/noGlobalIsFinite`

### Since: `v1.0.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.
This rule has an **unsafe** fix.

Use `Number.isFinite` instead of global `isFinite`.

`Number.isFinite()` and `isFinite()` do not have the same behavior. 
When the argument to `isFinite()` is not a number, the value is first coerced to a number.
`Number.isFinite()` does not perform this coercion.
Therefore, it is a more reliable way to test whether a number is finite.

### Examples

#### Invalid

isFinite(false); // true
```

#### Valid

# noGlobalObjectCalls

Disallow calling global object properties as functions

ECMAScript provides several global objects that are intended to be used as-is.
Some of these objects look as if they could be constructors due their capitalization (such as Math and JSON) but will throw an error if you try to execute them as functions.

The ECMAScript 5 specification makes it clear that both Math and JSON cannot be invoked:
The Math object does not have a [[Call]] internal property; it is not possible to invoke the Math object as a function.

The ECMAScript 2015 specification makes it clear that Reflect cannot be invoked:
The Reflect object also does not have a [[Call]] internal method; it is not possible to invoke the Reflect object as a function.

The ECMAScript 2017 specification makes it clear that Atomics cannot be invoked:
The Atomics object does not have a [[Call]] internal method; it is not possible to invoke the Atomics object as a function.

And the ECMAScript Internationalization API Specification makes it clear that Intl cannot be invoked:
The Intl object does not have a [[Call]] internal method; it is not possible to invoke the Intl object as a function.

## Examples

### Invalid

```javascript
var math = Math();
```

```javascript
var newMath = new Math();
```

```javascript
var json = JSON();
```

```javascript
var newJSON = new JSON();

# noHeadElement

Prevent usage of `<head>` element in a Next.js project.

**Diagnostic Category: `lint/nursery/noHeadElement`**

**Since**: `v1.9.4`

This rule is part of the nursery group.

Sources: 
- Same as: `@next/no-head-element`

Next.js provides a specialized `<Head />` component from `next/head` that manages
the `<head>` tag for optimal server-side rendering, client-side navigation, and
automatic deduplication of tags such as `<meta>` and `<title>`.

This rule only checks files that are outside of the `app/` directory, as it's typically
handled differently in Next.js.

## Examples

### Invalid

```jsx
function Index() {
  return (
    <head>
      <title>Invalid</title>
    </head>
  )
}
```

```text

# noHeadImportInDocument

**Diagnostic Category: `lint/nursery/noHeadImportInDocument`**

## Overview

Prevent using the `next/head` module in `pages/_document.js` on Next.js projects.

## Description

Importing `next/head` within the custom `pages/_document.js` file can cause unexpected behavior in your application. The `next/head` component is designed to be used at the page level, and when used in the custom document it can interfere with the global document structure, which leads to issues with rendering and SEO.

To modify `<head>` elements across all pages, you should use the `<Head />` component from the `next/document` module.

## Since
v1.9.4

## Sources
- Same as: `@next/no-head-import-in-document`

## Examples

### Valid

```jsx
// pages/_document.js
import Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from "next/document";

  static async getInitialProps(ctx) {
    //...
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Html>
        <Head></Head>
      </Html>

# noImgElement

Prevent usage of `<img>` element in a Next.js project.

**Diagnostic Category: `lint/nursery/noImgElement`**

**Since**: `v1.9.4`

This rule is part of the nursery group.

Sources: 
- Same as: `@next/no-img-element`

Using the `<img>` element can result in slower Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
and higher bandwidth usage, as it lacks the optimizations provided by the `<Image />`
component from `next/image`. Next.js's `<Image />` automatically optimizes images
by serving responsive sizes and using modern formats, improving performance and reducing bandwidth.

If your project is self-hosted, ensure that you have sufficient storage and have
installed the `sharp` package to support optimized images. When deploying to managed
hosting providers, be aware of potential additional costs or usage.

## Examples

### Invalid

```jsx
<img alt="Foo" />
```

```jsx
<div>
  <img alt="Foo" />

TypeScript variable declaration without any type annotation and initialization have the `any` type. The any type in TypeScript is a dangerous ‚Äúescape hatch‚Äù from the type system. Using any disables many type checking rules and is generally best used only as a last resort or when prototyping code. TypeScript‚Äôs `--noImplicitAny` compiler option doesn't report this case.

var a;
a = 2;

# noInferrableTypes

Disallow type annotations for variables, parameters, and class properties initialized with a literal expression.

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/style/noInferrableTypes`

### Since: `v1.0.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.
This rule has a **safe** fix.

Sources: 
- Same as: `@typescript-eslint/no-inferrable-types`

TypeScript is able to infer the types of parameters, properties, and variables from their default or initial values.
There is no need to use an explicit `:` type annotation for trivially inferred types (boolean, bigint, number, regex, string).
Doing so adds unnecessary verbosity to code making it harder to read.

In contrast to ESLint's rule, this rule allows to use a wide type for `const` declarations.
Moreover, the rule does not recognize `undefined` values, primitive type constructors (String, Number, ...), and `RegExp` type.
These global variables could be shadowed by local ones.

## Examples

### Invalid

```ts
const variable: 1 = 1;
```

```ts
let variable: number = 1;
```

```ts
class SomeClass {
  readonly field: 1 = 1;

}
```

```ts

# noInnerDeclarations

Disallow `function` and `var` declarations that are accessible outside their block.

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/correctness/noInnerDeclarations`

### Since: `v1.0.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.

Sources: 
- Same as: no-inner-declarations

Disallow `function` and `var` declarations that are accessible outside their block.

A `var` is accessible in the whole body of the nearest root (function, module, script, static block).
To avoid confusion, they should be declared to the nearest root.

Prior to ES2015, `function` declarations were only allowed in the nearest root,
though parsers sometimes erroneously accept them elsewhere.
In ES2015, inside an _ES module_, a `function` declaration is always block-scoped.

Note that `const` and `let` declarations are block-scoped,
and therefore they are not affected by this rule.
Moreover, `function` declarations in nested blocks are allowed inside _ES modules_.

## Examples

### Invalid

```cjs
if (test) {
    function f() {}
}
```

```js
if (test) {
    var x = 1;
}
```

```cjs

    }
}
```

```js
function f() {

Enforce that non-interactive ARIA roles are not assigned to interactive HTML elements.

Interactive HTML elements indicate controls in the user interface.
Interactive elements include `<a href>`, `<button>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`.
Non-interactive HTML elements and non-interactive ARIA roles indicate content and containers in the user interface.
Non-interactive elements include `<main>`, `<area>`, `<h1>` (,`<h2>`, etc), `<img>`, `<li>`, `<ul>` and `<ol>`.

WAI-ARIA roles should not be used to convert an interactive element to a non-interactive element.
Non-interactive ARIA roles include `article`, `banner`, `complementary`, `img`, `listitem`, `main`, `region` and `tooltip`.

## Examples

### Invalid

```jsx
<input role="img" />;
```

# noInvalidDirectionInLinearGradient

Disallow non-standard direction values for linear gradient functions.

## Diagnostic Category
lint/correctness/noInvalidDirectionInLinearGradient

## Since
v1.9.9

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.

## Sources
- Same as: stylelint/function-linear-gradient-no-nonstandard-direction

## Description
Disallow non-standard direction values for linear gradient functions.

A valid and standard direction value is one of the following:

- an angle
- to plus a side-or-corner (to top, to bottom, to left, to right; to top right, to right top, to bottom left, etc.)

A common mistake (matching outdated non-standard syntax) is to use just a side-or-corner without the preceding to.

## Examples

### Invalid

```css
.foo { background: linear-gradient(top, #fff, #000); }
```

```css
.foo { background: linear-gradient(45, #fff, #000); }
```

### Valid

```css
.foo { background: linear-gradient(to top, #fff, #000); }

# noLabelWithoutControl

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/a11y/noLabelWithoutControl`

### Since: `v1.8.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.

Sources: 
- Same as: jsx-a11y/label-has-associated-control

Enforce that a label element or component has a text label and an associated input.

An "input" is considered one of the following elements: `input`, `meter`, `output`, `progress`, `select` or `textarea`.

There are two supported ways to associate a label with an input:

- Wrapping an input in a label element.
- Adding a `for` attribute (or `htmlFor` in React) to a label and assigning it a DOM ID string associated with an input on the page.

This rule checks that any `label` element (or an indicated custom component that will output a `label` element) meets one of these conditions:

- Wraps an `input` element (or an indicated custom component that will output an `input` element)
- Has a `for` or `htmlFor` attribute and that the `label` element/component has accessible text content.

## Examples

### Invalid

```jsx
<label for="js_id" />;
```

```jsx
<label for="js_id"><input /></label>;
```

```jsx
<label htmlFor="js_id" />;
```

```jsx
<label htmlFor="js_id"><input /></label>;
```

```jsx
<label>A label</label>;
```

```jsx
<div><label /><input /></div>;
```

### Valid

```jsx
<label for="js_id" aria-label="A label" />;
<label for="js_id" aria-labelledby="A label" />;
<label htmlFor="js_id" aria-label="A label" />;
<label htmlFor="js_id" aria-labelledby="A label" />;
<label>A label<input /></label>;
<label>A label<textarea /></label>;
<label><img alt="A label" /><input /></label>;
```

## Options

The rule supports the following options:

- `inputComponents` - An array of component names that should be considered the same as an `input` element.
- `labelAttributes` - An array of attributes that should be treated as the `label` accessible text content.
- `labelComponents` - An array of component names that should be considered the same as a `label` element.

Both options `inputComponents` and `labelComponents` don't have support for namespace components (e.g. `<Control.Input>`).

```json
{
    "//": "...",
    "options": {
        "inputComponents": ["CustomInput"],
        "labelAttributes": ["label"],
        "labelComponents": ["CustomLabel"]

# noMisleadingCharacterClass

Disallow characters made with multiple code points in character class syntax.

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/suspicious/noMisleadingCharacterClass`

### Since: `v1.5.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.
This rule has a **safe** fix.

Sources: 
- Same as: no-misleading-character-class

Disallow characters made with multiple code points in character class syntax.

Unicode includes the characters which are made with multiple code points. e.g. AÃÅ, üáØüáµ, üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶.
A RegExp character class `/[abc]/` cannot handle characters with multiple code points.
For example, the character `‚ùáÔ∏è` consists of two code points: `‚ùá` (U+2747) and `VARIATION SELECTOR-16` (U+FE0F).
If this character is in a RegExp character class, it will match to either `‚ùá` or `VARIATION SELECTOR-16` rather than `‚ùáÔ∏è`.
This rule reports the regular expressions which include multiple code point characters in character class syntax.

## Examples

### Invalid

```js
/^[AÃÅ]$/u;

# noMisleadingInstantiator

**Diagnostic Category: `lint/suspicious/noMisleadingInstantiator`**

**Since**: `v1.3.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.

Sources: 
- Same as: `@typescript-eslint/no-misused-new`

Enforce proper usage of `new` and `constructor`.

In JavaScript, classes utilize the `constructor` method to initialize a new instance. On the other hand, TypeScript interfaces can describe a class type with a `new()` method signature, though this pattern is not commonly seen in real-world code. Developers, especially those new to JavaScript or TypeScript, might occasionally confuse the use of `constructor` with `new`.

This rule triggers warnings in the following scenarios:

- When a class has a method named `new`.
- When an interface defines a method named `constructor` or `new` that returns the interface type.
- When a type alias has a `constructor` method.

You should not use this rule if you intentionally want a class with a `new` method, and you're confident nobody working in your code will mistake it with an `constructor`.

## Examples

### Invalid

```ts
interface I {
  new (): I;
  constructor(): void;
}
```

```text
code-block.ts:2:3 lint/suspicious/noMisleadingInstantiator 
 Don't use the new method in interfaces.
  1 ‚îÇ interface I {
> 2 ‚îÇ   new (): I;
 ‚îÇ   ^^^^^^^^^^^
  3 ‚îÇ   constructor(): void;
 4 ‚îÇ }
 
 new in an interface suggests it's instantiable, which is incorrect. The returned type should different from the constructor's type.
```

```ts
class C {
  new(): C;
}
```

```text
code-block.ts:2:3 lint/suspicious/noMisleadingInstantiator 
 Don't use the new method in classes.
  1 ‚îÇ class C {
> 2 ‚îÇ   new(): C;
 ‚îÇ   ^^^^^^^
  3 ‚îÇ }
 
 new is typically used to instantiate objects. In classes, its usage can be misleading.
```

### Valid

```ts
declare class C {
  constructor();
}

interface I {
  new (): C;
}
```

# noMisplacedAssertion

**Diagnostic Category: `lint/suspicious/noMisplacedAssertion`**

**Since**: `v1.8.0`
Sources: 
- Inspired from: jest/no-standalone-expect

Checks that the assertion function, for example `expect`, is placed inside an `it()` function call.

Placing (and using) the `expect` assertion function can result in unexpected behaviors when executing your testing suite.

The rule will check for the following assertion calls:

- `expect`
- `assert`
- `assertEquals`

However, the rule will ignore the following assertion calls:

- `expect.any`
- `expect.anything`
- `expect.closeTo`
- `expect.arrayContaining`
- `expect.objectContaining`
- `expect.stringContaining`
- `expect.stringMatching`
- `expect.extend`
- `expect.addEqualityTesters`
- `expect.addSnapshotSerializer`

If the assertion function is imported, the rule will check if they are imported from:

- `"chai"`
- `"node:assert"`
- `"node:assert/strict"`
- `"bun:test"`
- `"vitest"`
- Deno assertion module URL

Check the [options](#options) if you need to change the defaults.

## Examples

# noNamespaceImport

Disallow the use of namespace imports.

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/style/noNamespaceImport`

### Since: `v1.6.0`

Sources: 
- Same as: barrel-files/avoid-namespace-import

Namespace imports might impact the efficiency of tree shaking, a process that removes unused code from bundles.
The effectiveness of tree shaking largely depends on the bundler (e.g., Webpack, Rollup) and its configuration.
Modern bundlers are generally capable of handling namespace imports effectively, but using named imports is recommended for optimal tree shaking and minimizing bundle size.

## Examples

### Invalid

```js
import * as foo from "foo";
```

### Error Message

Avoid namespace imports, it can prevent efficient tree shaking and increase bundle size.

### Valid

```ts
import { foo } from "foo"
import type { bar } from "bar"
import type * as baz from "baz"
```

# noNonNullAssertion

Disallow non-null assertions using the `!` postfix operator.

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/style/noNonNullAssertion`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.
This rule has an **unsafe** fix.

Sources: 
- Same as: `@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion`

TypeScript's `!` non-null assertion operator asserts to the type system that an expression is non-nullable, as
in not `null` or `undefined`. Using assertions to tell the type system new information is often a sign that
code is not fully type-safe. It's generally better to structure program logic so that TypeScript understands
when values may be nullable.

## Examples

### Invalid

```ts
interface Example {
  property?: string;
}
declare const foo: Example;
const includesBaz = foo.property!.includes('baz');
```

```ts
(b!! as number) = "test";
```

### Valid

# noNonoctalDecimalEscape

**Diagnostic Category: `lint/correctness/noNonoctalDecimalEscape`**

**Since**: `v1.0.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.
This rule has an **unsafe** fix.

Sources: 
- Same as: no-nonoctal-decimal-escape

Disallow `\8` and `\9` escape sequences in string literals.

Since ECMAScript 2021, the escape sequences \8 and \9 have been defined as non-octal decimal escape sequences.
However, most JavaScript engines consider them to be "useless" escapes. For example:

```js
"\8" === "8"; // true
"\9" === "9"; // true
```

Although this syntax is deprecated, it is still supported for compatibility reasons.
If the ECMAScript host is not a web browser, this syntax is optional.
However, web browsers are still required to support it, but only in non-strict mode.
Regardless of your targeted environment, it is recommended to avoid using these escape sequences in new code.

## Examples

### Invalid

```js
const x = "\8";
```

```js
const x = "Don't use \8 escape.";
```

```js
const x = "Don't use \9 escape.";
```

### Valid

```js
const x = "8";
```

```js
const x = "Don't use \\8 and \\9 escapes.";
```

# noParameterAssign

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.

Sources: 
- Same as: no-param-reassign

Assignment to a `function` parameters can be misleading and confusing,
as modifying parameters will also mutate the `arguments` object.
It is often unintended and indicative of a programmer error.

In contrast to the _ESLint_ rule, this rule cannot be configured to report
assignments to a property of a parameter.

## Examples

### Invalid

```js
function f(param) {

# noParameterProperties

Disallow the use of parameter properties in class constructors.

## Diagnostic Category
lint/style/noParameterProperties

## Since
v1.0.0

## Sources
Inspired from: @typescript-eslint/parameter-properties

TypeScript includes a "parameter properties" shorthand for declaring a class constructor parameter and class property in one location.
Parameter properties can confuse those new to TypeScript as they are less explicit than other ways of declaring and initializing class members.
Moreover, private class properties, starting with #, cannot be turned into "parameter properties".
This questions the future of this feature.

## Examples

### Invalid

```ts
class A {
    constructor(readonly name: string) {}
}
```

### Error Message
Use a more explicit class property instead of a parameter property.

# noProcessEnv

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/nursery/noProcessEnv`

### Since: `v1.9.1`

This rule is part of the nursery group.

Sources: 
- Same as: n/no-process-env

Disallow the use of `process.env`.

The `process.env` object in Node.js stores configuration settings. Using it directly throughout a project can cause problems:

1. It's harder to maintain
2. It can lead to conflicts in team development
3. It complicates deployment across multiple servers

A better practice is to keep all settings in one configuration file and reference it throughout the project.

## Examples

### Invalid

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  // ...
}
```

### Error Message

Don't use `process.env`.
Use a centralized configuration file instead for better maintainability and deployment consistency.

# noPrototypeBuiltins

Disallow direct use of `Object.prototype` builtins.

## Diagnostic Category: `lint/suspicious/noPrototypeBuiltins`

### Since: `v1.1.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.
This rule has a **safe** fix.

Sources: 
- Same as: no-prototype-builtins
- Same as: prefer-object-has-own

Disallow direct use of `Object.prototype` builtins.

ECMAScript 5.1 added `Object.create` which allows the creation of an object with a custom prototype.
This pattern is often used for objects used as Maps. However, this pattern can lead to errors
if something else relies on prototype properties/methods.
Moreover, the methods could be shadowed, this can lead to random bugs and denial of service
vulnerabilities. For example, calling `hasOwnProperty` directly on parsed JSON like `{"hasOwnProperty": 1}` could lead to vulnerabilities.
To avoid subtle bugs like this, you should call these methods from `Object.prototype`.
For example, `foo.isPrototypeOf(bar)` should be replaced with `Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf.call(foo, "bar")`
As for the `hasOwn` method, `foo.hasOwn("bar")` should be replaced with `Object.hasOwn(foo, "bar")`.

## Examples

### Invalid

```js
var invalid = foo.hasOwnProperty("bar");
```

```js
var invalid = foo.isPrototypeOf(bar);
```

```js
var invalid = foo.propertyIsEnumerable("bar");
```

```js

```

### Valid

```js
var valid = Object.hasOwn(foo, "bar");

# noRedundantUseStrict

**Diagnostic Category: `lint/suspicious/noRedundantUseStrict`**

**Since**: `v1.0.0`

This rule is recommended by Biome. A diagnostic error will appear when linting your code.
This rule has a **safe** fix.

Prevents from having redundant `"use strict"`.

The directive `"use strict"` **isn't** needed in `.mjs` files, or in `.js` files inside projects where the `package.json` defines library as module:

```json
{
   "type": "module"
}
```

Instead, `.cjs` files are considered "scripts" and the directive `"use strict"` is accepted and advised.

Note that the leading trivia, e.g., comments or newlines preceding
the redundant `"use strict"` will also be removed. So that comment
directives won't be transferred to a wrong place.

## Examples

### Invalid

```cjs
"use strict";
function foo() {
 	"use strict";
}
```

```cjs
"use strict";
"use strict";

function foo() {

}
```

```cjs
function foo() {
"use strict";
"use strict";
}
```

```cjs
class C1 {
	test() {
		"use strict";
	}
};
```

```cjs
const C2 = class {
	test() {
		"use strict";
	}
};
```

### Valid

```cjs
function foo() {

}
```

```cjs
 function foo() {
    "use strict";
}
function bar() {
    "use strict";
}
```

# noRenderReturnValue

Diagnostic Category: `lint/correctness/noRenderReturnValue`

**Since**: `v1.0.0`

Prevent the usage of the return value of `React.render`.

`ReactDOM.render()` currently returns a reference to the root `ReactComponent` instance. However, using this return value is legacy and should be avoided because future versions of React may render components asynchronously in some cases. If you need a reference to the root `ReactComponent` instance, the preferred solution is to attach a callback ref to the root element.

Source: ReactDOM documentation https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-dom.html#render

## Examples

### Invalid

```jsx
const foo = ReactDOM.render(<div />, document.body);
```

### Error Message

Do not depend on the value returned by the function `ReactDOM.render()`. The returned value is legacy and future versions of React might return that value asynchronously. Check the React documentation for more information.

### Valid

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(<div />, document.body);
```

# noRestrictedGlobals

This rule allows you to specify global variable names that you don‚Äôt want to use in your application.

## Diagnostic Category
lint/style/noRestrictedGlobals

## Since
v1.0.0

## Sources
- Same as: no-restricted-globals

This rule allows you to specify global variable names that you don‚Äôt want to use in your application.

Disallowing usage of specific global variables can be useful if you want to allow a set of global variables by enabling an environment, but still want to disallow some of those.

## Examples

### Invalid
```js
console.log(event)
```

### Diagnostic
Do not use the global variable event.
Use a local variable instead.

### Valid
```js
function f(event) {
    console.log(event)
}
```

## Options
Use the options to specify additional globals that you want to restrict in your source code.

```json
{
    "options": {
        "deniedGlobals": ["$", "MooTools"]
    }
}
```

In the example above, the rule will emit a diagnostics if tried to use `$` or `MooTools` without creating a local variable.
